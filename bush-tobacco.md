Also known as cattle bush, this shrubby plant has blue flowers and lanceolate leaves and was once used as an inebriant (Webb 1969). In Australia (Arnhem Land), the dried leaves formerly were used as a substitute for tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) (Low 1990, 190*). The entire plant contains 0.01 to 0.070/0 alkaloids (Collins et al. 1990,31*).

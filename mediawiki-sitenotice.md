# Salvinorin A

**Salvinorin A** is the primary psychoactive compound found in *Salvia divinorum*, a plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is a unique hallucinogen in that it is a diterpenoid rather than an alkaloid, and it acts as a highly selective κ-opioid receptor agonist.

## Chemical Properties

Salvinorin A has the molecular formula C23H28O8 and a molecular weight of 432.47 g/mol. It is a white crystalline solid that is nearly insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents such as acetone and ethanol.

### Structure

The compound features a unique bicyclic structure with multiple functional groups including lactone rings and acetate groups. This complex structure is responsible for its specific binding affinity to κ-opioid receptors.

## Pharmacology

### Mechanism of Action

Salvinorin A is a potent and selective κ-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist. Unlike most other hallucinogens that primarily act on serotonin receptors, particularly the 5-HT2A receptor, salvinorin A's psychoactive effects are mediated entirely through the κ-opioid system.

### Receptor Binding

- **κ-opioid receptor**: High affinity agonist (Ki = 40 nM)
- **μ-opioid receptor**: No significant activity
- **δ-opioid receptor**: No significant activity
- **Serotonin receptors**: No significant activity

### Pharmacokinetics

Salvinorin A has a very short duration of action when smoked, typically lasting 5-30 minutes. It is rapidly metabolized by the enzyme carboxylesterase-1 into salvinorin B, which is inactive at κ-opioid receptors.

## Effects

The effects of salvinorin A are dose-dependent and can range from subtle perceptual changes to complete dissociation from reality.

### Subjective Effects

- **Perceptual distortions**: Visual hallucinations, altered sense of space and time
- **Dissociation**: Out-of-body experiences, loss of personal identity
- **Emotional effects**: Dysphoria, anxiety, or occasionally euphoria
- **Physical sensations**: Feeling of being pulled or twisted, loss of motor control

### Dose Response

- **Threshold**: 200-500 μg (smoked)
- **Light**: 500-1000 μg
- **Common**: 1-5 mg
- **Strong**: 5-12 mg
- **Heavy**: 12+ mg

## Safety and Risks

### Psychological Risks

- **Acute anxiety or panic**: Common during the experience
- **Disorientation**: Risk of injury due to loss of awareness of surroundings
- **Unpredictable behavior**: Users may act in ways that could be dangerous

### Physical Risks

- **Falls and injuries**: Due to loss of motor control and awareness
- **Respiratory depression**: Minimal risk compared to classical opioids

### Harm Reduction

- Always use with a sober sitter present
- Use in a safe, familiar environment
- Remove potential hazards from the area
- Avoid operating machinery or driving
- Start with small doses to assess sensitivity

## Legal Status

The legal status of salvinorin A varies by jurisdiction:

- **United States**: Controlled in some states, legal federally
- **European Union**: Varies by country
- **Australia**: Scheduled substance
- **Canada**: Legal to possess, illegal to sell for human consumption

## Research Applications

Salvinorin A has attracted significant research interest due to its unique pharmacological profile:

### Therapeutic Potential

- **Depression treatment**: KOR antagonists show antidepressant properties
- **Addiction research**: Understanding κ-opioid system in addiction
- **Pain management**: Potential for non-addictive analgesics

### Scientific Studies

Research has focused on understanding the κ-opioid system and developing synthetic analogs with improved therapeutic profiles and reduced hallucinogenic effects.

## Analogs and Derivatives

Several synthetic analogs of salvinorin A have been developed for research purposes:

- **Salvinorin B**: Inactive metabolite
- **2-methoxymethyl salvinorin B**: Synthetic analog with modified properties
- **Herkinorin**: Semi-synthetic derivative with different receptor selectivity

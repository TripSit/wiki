This page is a W.I.P and most likely will always be one. This most likely will not have the common psychedelics you are used to, but if you ever want to learn more about the "other" side of psychedelics, this could potentially be a starting point. There also may (There is as of this edit) doubles, as this started as a project between two people, and mashed together.

- BOL-148 - 2-bromo found by Hofmann, inactive as a psychedelic, acts as a neutal antagonist, which makes it "useful" in cluster headaches and a bit more. (E.G useful in medicine, not in my hands)

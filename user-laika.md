I am a tripsitter on the network and my interest in pharmacology has helped me gain important harm reduction information regarding drug use. I'm always learning and I hope to help improve necessary content so that harm reduction information is accessible for people.

I am a computer science student on track to graduate in the summer of 2016, so I believe some of my programming knowledge can be useful.

I have worked two summers as a maintenance worker, chef, and camp counselor at a camp for inner-city Detroit (Michigan) children. This experience has helped me understand conflict resolution, managing panic in others, and community building.

| This tropical rain forest plant is found in West Africa, where the Pygmies used it as an alternative agent of pleasure and inebriant to bangi (Cannabis sativa) and tava (Nicotiana tabacum): In an emergency, when there is no tobacco or hemp to be found, the Pygmies turn to the leaves of a forest plant, medeaka, which they smoke. The effects are said to be stronger than those of bangi [= Cannabis sativa]. But it does not seem correct that the leaves of the poisonous tava tree are smoked as well. (Schebesta 1941, 179) The root, which was known as masili, was chewed as an aphrodisiac (Schebesta 1941, 236). This plant may be one of the many West African Mitragyna species (cf. [Mitragyna speciosa](/en/mitragyna-speciosa)). | **Literature** Schebesta, Paul. 1941. Die Bambuti-Pygmaen von Ituri, vol. 2: Ethnographie der Ituri-Bambuti. Brussels: George van Campenhout. |

During the past several years, new types of beverages have been developed in connection with the rave and techno culture. Marketed as "energy drinks", they are offered to ravers as stimulating, healthy alternatives to alcohol, which in the rave culture is becoming increasingly frowned upon as a party drug (Ahrens 1994, Millman and Beeder 1994). Many of the names of these drinks-for example, Mystery (an "official Michael Jackson Product"), Fit for Fun, Flying Horse, Warp 4 Space Drink, Cult Energy Activator, Magic Man, Taurus, and XTC (= ecstasy = MDMA)-suggest improbable psychoactive effects. The basis of most of these products is guarana (see [paullinia cupana](/en/paullinia-cupana)). They usually also contain various vitamins, DHA (polyunsaturated fatty acids), taurine (a substance that appears to be pharmacologically inactive), propolis, and pure caffeine. However, the caffeine concentration typically is not as high as that found in a cup of coffee (cf. [coffea arabica](/en/coffea-arabica)). In other words, these products are as frustrating as [herbal ecstasy](/en/herbal-ecstasy).

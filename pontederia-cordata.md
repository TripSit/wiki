In the Colombian region of the Amazon, this plant is known as amarron borrachero ("hazelwort inebriator"). It is used as an ayahuasca additive but may also possibly be used alone for psychoactive purposes (Schultes 1972, 141*). The plant is used ethnomedicinally to treat facial paralysis (Schultes 1981, 5*). There is also a North American variety: Pontederia cordata 1. var. lancifolia.

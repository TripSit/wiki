Scopolamine, also known as hyoscine, is a tropane alkaloid found in various nightshade plants, including Belladonna and Datura. Historically, it has been used as a poison in some cultures and is also used as a medication for motion sickness. Scopolamine is toxic at recreational doses. Use can lead to memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction.

### Dosage
Scopolamine should not be taken in its plant form as the potency can vary greatly. The recreational dose, if any, is not well established. The recommended therapeutic dose is usually 0.2mg to 0.4mg, and it should only be taken under medical supervision. Another form of Scopolamine, butylscopolamine, can be found in smoked Buscopan tablets, however, a safe recreational dose has not been established.

### Harm Reduction
Physostigmine has been used to treat the effects of scopolamine.
Scopolamine should not be mixed with other anticholinergics, alcohol, zolpidem, or stimulants.
Due to the delirium caused by scopolamine, it shouldn't be used in combination with other hallucinogens.
For the same reason, It's important to have a trip sitter present when taking Scopolamine, as the user may not be able to distinguish reality from hallucinations.

### Pharmacology
Scopolamine acts as an antimuscarinic at the m1 receptor. It works by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholine, which leads to the symptoms associated with Scopolamine toxicity. It also blocks the cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus.

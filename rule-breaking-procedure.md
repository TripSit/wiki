### As a staff member/user

1. ~report the user

### As a TripSitter

1. Verbal warning to please chill out or leave the room.

   * In the event of serious trolls, this may be skipped.

2. ~quiet [time] <#channel> <username> <reason> to quiet problematic users in #tripsit.

3. ~report <user> and discuss the problem with other staff in #teamtripsit.

4. Join #tripsit.me, say ~teamtripsit, and give detailed information to the staff.

### As a Moderator

When you receive a ~report about a user, or witness the activity yourself:

1. Check the rules matrix for a general idea of how certain situations should be dealt with https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfBh2--ymg6fbyUnb3Lv191cfjyD9ogqMSEhOgmd5og/edit#gid=0 (please note this may be slightly out of date, ask if you are unsure)

2. Verbal warning to please chill out.

   * If user is doing a serious infraction, this may be skipped, and you may immediately:

3. ~quiet the user for a specified time limit.

   * For minor infractions 10 minutes is a pretty good number.

4. Talk to the user.

   * **This may be the most important step. A user needs to know what they did wrong and should hear it from a human rather than a robot.**

5. ~warn the user (if necessary) providing information about the encounter.

   * Warning will be sent via PM on most occasions as to avoid drama in the main channels and a note will be added to their record.

   * Occasionally public warnings will be issued to show to others what the rules are, but please don't "make an example" out of anyone.

6. If a ~warn is not necessary, ~notify #tripsit.me of the outcome of the interaction.

7. If the above ~quiet was not timed, remember to undo the quiet.

   * You can use ~remindme <time> <reason> to set a reminder for yourself to unquiet.

# Remember to keep logs and documentation on TripCloud when necessary.

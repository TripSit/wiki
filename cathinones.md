# Cathinone

Cathinone (also known as benzoylethanamine, or β-keto-amphetamine) is a monoamine alkaloid found in the shrub Catha edulis (khat) and is chemically similar to ephedrine, methcathinone and other amphetamines. Cathinone differs from many other amphetamines in that it has a ketone functional group.

Other phenethylamines that share this structure include the stimulants methcathinone, MDPV, mephedrone and the antidepressant bupropion among others.

Cathinones has been found to stimulate the release of dopamine and inhibit the reuptake of epinephrine, norepinephrine and serotonin in the central nervous system (CNS).

The metabolites of cathinone, cathine and norephedrine also possess CNS stimulation, but create much weaker effects. The effects of cathinone on the body can be countered by a preceding administration of a dopamine-receptor antagonist.[12] The antagonist will keep the neuron at its resting state, so the cathinone cannot cause extraneous release of dopamine or other neurotransmitters.

It can also induce dry mouth, blurred vision and increased blood pressure and heart rate.

**Experience**

Cath's and syn cathinones are some of the dirtiest chemicals that do not have much positive effects. There form of action does not give much euphoria and can cause serious delusions.

Personally having done plenty in the past I can say that they should be avoided. Racing heart rate,, insomnia and delusions of police after you. Ultra focus is a side effect and as well as compulsive masturbation; paranoia. Avoid them at all costs... and if need be benzos can help bring you down. One of the better caths is Pentedrone; however, it is not so stimmy and has a nice euphoria.

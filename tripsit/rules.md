# Contact Us
## Technical problems can be brought up in #help.

<details>
<summary>The <strong>#help</strong> room has staff there to address anything related to technical problems with the IRC network, subreddit, or website.</summary>

If you need help connecting via our TOR client, this is the channel to get assistance.

This is not a room to get help with drug information, and you will be kindly redirected to #tripsit or #drugs for that.

</details>

## You may talk to the TripSit Managers to ask questions or give feedback via IRC in the #tripsit.me channel

<details>
<summary>You can access this room on IRC by saying <em>/join #tripsit.me</em> or using <a href="http://chat.tripsit.me/?nick=Problem?#tripsit.me">this link</a>.</summary>

Please join this room if you are unclear or need further explanation about any IRC rules.

We ask that non-staff do not idle in this room, so when you are finished, please leave the channel using the /part #channel command.

</details>

## If rules are broken, use the ~report command to notify staff
<details>
<summary>Syntax is: <strong>~report &lt;#channel&gt; &lt;user&gt; &lt;reason&gt;</strong></summary>

Rules are enforced by the TripSit staff; as much as we try, we cannot monitor every aspect of our network all the time.

We encourage users to use reports to get attention to a situation quickly.

Should you witness a user breaking one of the following rules, use the '~report' command to notify the TripSit [staff](/en/tripsit/list-of-staff-and-their-roles).

Try to be as clear and detailed as possible when explaining the nature of the event.

</details>

## Ban evasion will extend your ban, please email appeals (at) tripsit (dot) me to appeal a ban

<details>
<summary>Do not evade a ban issued to you. Ban evasion will result in a removal from the server (k-line) and an extension of the ban.</summary>

Ban evasion is when you enter a TripSit room while still under the effect of a ban, regardless of how you entered the room.

This includes making a new Nickserv account, changing your IP or doing anything else to get around the ban.

While banned, you can still enter non-TripSit rooms and #tripsit.me.

If you wish to discuss a ban, email the admins at appeals (at) tripsit (dot) me.

</details>

## To appeal a k-line, email the admins
<details>
<summary>If you have been removed from the network with a k-line, you can send an email to appeals (at) tripsit (dot) me.</summary>

We will investigate and get back to you as soon as we can.

You can also send a modmail to /r/tripsit, but please, do not make a post on /r/tripsit.

</details>

## Do not ruin the TripSit community for others

<details>
<summary>Do not use TripSit for any purpose which could impair any other party's use or enjoyment of this site.</summary>

We are a community, and everyone on the internet deserves to enjoy being here.

Actions that make this community anything less than a pleasant place to be will be dealt with appropriately.

</details>

### No information is better than wrong information
<details>
<summary>If you are not 100% positive about the advice you are thinking about giving, do not say it.</summary>

It is still better to inform the person there may be no current information rather than staying silent and having them wonder if anyone noticed it.

In most instances, people on the internet are not qualified to provide medical advice.

Members of the TripSit community are extremely knowledgeable, wise, and often have ample life experience in a range of situations pertaining to drug use; however, they are no substitute for a personal doctor.

If you do not have sources to validate your advice, do not say anything related to medical advice.

</details>

## Do not suggest harmful actions to others

<details>
<summary>It is against the rules to endorse or encourage dangerous behavior regarding drug consumption.</summary>

The TripSit community is devoted to [harm reduction](/en/harm-reduction-supplies), support, and positvitiy, and we will never recommend or tolerate dangerous or reckless drug use.

Users identified as continually engaging in reckless drug-use behavior are seen as a bad influence on the community as a whole, actively working against our [mission](http://tripsit.me/about-tripsit/about-tripsit/) to be a a harm-reduction community devoted to positive support.

All users are expected to discourage drug dosages, [drug combinations](/en/guides/drug-combinations), or any drug experimentation which could be reliably considered unsafe.

Discussion, requesting or posting the personally identifying information of websites, online vendors (this includes websites such as Amazon) and real-life people who sell or coordinate the purchase, distribution, or production of: Chemicals (legal, grey-area, or illegal), services and currencies (bitcoin).

# TripSit Channel Policies

## Use common sense and do not do questionable things
<details>
<summary>If you have any doubt over whether your topic, question, advice, or comment is acceptable, feel free to join <strong>#tripsit.me</strong>.</summary>

We are happy to give you a solid judgement on whether your topic is acceptable in private without judgement or consequence.

We like to deal with other behaviors in a softer manner, by guiding the user and explaining to them what is and isn't allowed.

In the case of repeated offences or a bad attitude, we reserve the right to forego these protocols in favor of the community.

Every case is unique and will be dealt with to the best of the ability of the [staff](/en/tripsit/list-of-staff-and-their-roles) on duty at the time.

</details>

## Keep It Positive Please
<details>
<summary>This basically means no rude, mean, or judgmental discussion.</summary>

We are a network devoted to harm reduction and positivity.

One of our policies is to try and Keep It Positive (KIP).

Please refrain from racial slurs, homophobia, and all other prejudice against any person or group of people.

Do not insult other users; take intense arguments to private chat.

Use of the words "nigger" or "faggot" is prohibited and will result in an auto-quiet, due to the complete lack of productive conversation surrounding them.

</details>

## Keep the #tripsit, #tripsit1, #tripsit2 and #tripsit3 channels awesome
<details>
<summary>These channels should always be ready to help fellow members.</summary>

The #tripsit channels are for people currently under the influence of drugs and those there to sit them.

Please take any drug discussion, arguments or otherwise distracting chatter to #drugs instead.

Only light-hearted, positive and helpful conversation here: We all know how easily a trip can turn bad just by a simple thought.

Anyone caught being facetious will be warned and then banned if need be.

Rules are **STRICTLY** enforced in this channel.

</details>

## Do not post gore, mark NSFW links as such
<details>
<summary>Do not post any gore. Please mark any content 18+ with a NSFW label.</summary>

The general subject of our network is not work appropriate, but there is a difference between text and pictures that are not safe for work.

Please be courteous to those with the luxury of being on the network while at work.

</details>

## Do not argue rules in public channels, take it to #tripsit.me
<details>
<summary>Arguing a ban, quiet, or general rule is not allowed in public channels, but is encouraged in #tripsit.me</summary>

Arguing against established practices in large channels is rarely productive.

However, the TripSit team wants to hear your opinion, and welcomes rule discussion in #tripsit.me

We are happy to discuss any ambiguity in our rules that is not covered on this page.

</details>

## Do not use poor language
<details>
<summary>To ensure maintaining a comfortable atmosphere, certain words trigger an auto-quiet.</summary>

We believe in free speech, but certain words have proven to only lead to a degradation in community discussion. They are:

Nigger

Faggot

</details>

## Do not impersonate law enforcement
<details>
<summary>For the sake of everyone's peace of mind, impersonating law enforcement is against our rules.</summary>

Impersonating an officer of the law will first result in a warning.

If the user does not comply, the user will be kicked.

Repeated attempts to impersonate law enforcement will result in a temporary or permanent ban.

</details>

## Do not impersonate medical professionals
<details>
<summary>To help prevent confusion about the validity of the advice given here, we ask that people do not impersonate medical professionals.</summary>

Having "Dr" in your name or otherwise implying that you have the ability to give medical advice is a grey area and you may be asked to change your nickname if we feel it could imply to a new user that you are capable of giving medical advice.

Remember that our organization is not here to give direct medical advice and it should not be implied that any of us are medical professionals.

Even if you have a medical license you must be able to understand that giving advice over the internet should be avoided.

</details>

## Do not give wrong or misleading medical advice to others
<details>
<summary>Please avoid spreading misinformation about drug use.</summary>

Do not post any content that is libelous, deceptive, fraudulent, tortuous or inaccurate.

Misinformation is harmful to our community.

</details>

## Do not ignore harm reduction advice given by staff and community
<details>
<summary>If a user has taken or continues to take a dangerous dose or combination, they may be forced to leave the network</summary>

Occasionally we have users join our community mistakenly expecting that, due to the subject matter of the community, we will support them in their dangerous behavior, use, and/or attitudes towards drug use.

It is seen as the responsibility of not only the staff, but the community's members to actively discourage dangerous behavior.

Please accept and consider the advice given to you seriously and note that ignorance of advice pertaining to potentially life threatening situations will not be tolerated by our community.

As such, these behaviors are considered against the rules and violators may be subjected to temporary or permanent bans (situation depending).

</details>

## Do not threaten suicide
<details>
<summary>While TripSitters will try their best to help member cope with down feelings of depression or worse, we cannot tolerate threats of suicide.</summary>

Suicide, depression and mental illness are not the focus of our network and our staff is not adequately trained to deal with suicidal situations, nor is it fair to our network's members to have the onus of guilt placed upon them for potential outcomes of such situations.

If a member is experiencing suicidal thoughts or tendencies, we kindly ask them to consider professional therapeutic assistance.

In a situation in which we fear for a user's life, we will remind them of the guidelines stated above and do everything in our power to assist the member find qualified help.

These behaviors disrupt the primary objectives of our community.

Therefore, suicide threats and attempts are considered against the rules, and while we will try our best to help in the immediate timescale, such threats and attempts may result in either a temporary or permanent ban from the community (under discretion from the administrators).

We endorse Reddit's [SuicideWatch](http://reddit.com/r/suicidewatch) community.

</details>

## Do not mix drugs and mental illness
<details>
<summary>The TripSit community will not serve as enabler for the destruction of mental or physical health.</summary>

While we are very accepting of members who may have mental illnesses and/or disorders, we do not condone or encourage the use or abuse of drugs that could interact, worsen, or otherwise negatively affect your health.

Please seek medical assistance if you have a question regarding mental illnesses or disorders and their interactions with drugs.

We are not qualified to provide professional medical advice on drug interactions with mental illnesses.

If you want to discuss the topic, feel free to bring it up in our IRC channels or message the TripSit team.

We are happy to discuss any topic at length with you, warn you of any potential drug interactions as well as give you advice, love, respect and positive energy to the best of our ability.

The TripSit community is always here to help and support you, no matter what. We love you and want to keep you with us!

Please note: This has never happened.

</details>

## We do not watch private messages

TripSit and its managers have the right to remove, edit, move or close any submitted data at any time should they choose to.

</details>

A lawyer will be contacted in this event, as well as yourself.

</details>

### Please note this has never happened

# Non-TripSit rooms

## We do not watch every channel created, but if we hear a report, we will take action
<details>
<summary>We reserve the right to take action in non-TripSit rooms if the Terms of Service have been broken.</summary>

The TripSit Team will not police rooms created by users, however, if there are reports of activity going against our rules we reserve the right to intervene, including the permanent takeover or shutdown of a channel.

Channels that are created on our network, official or otherwise, still adhere to our terms of service.

If a channel is in violation of the terms of service, the Tripsit administrative team reserves the right to permanently close or delete a channel, and ban the users in violation of the terms of service.

</details>

# Underage users
## We do not allow minors (users under the age of 18) on the network, with the exception of the assistance channels #tripsit and #sanctuary
<details>
<summary><strong>TripSit at large is a place children and young teenagers should not be exposed to directly.</strong></summary>

TripSit will provide assistance to anyone in our #tripsit and #sanctuary room.

Using the #sanctuary room while underage is only permitted if under the influence of drugs, and after being redirected from #tripsit. Regular use of the channel while under 18 is not permitted.

However, we believe it is not wise for minors to be influenced by the wider drug-related community until a later age.

Furthermore, in order to encourage a productive drug-tolerant community, we must allow our members to have the confidence that what they say will not be negatively influencing young people who have not had the same education and experience they do.

</details>

## We do not allow anyone under the age of 13 to be on the network
<details>
<summary><strong>This is in accordance with the Child Online Protection Act, and is required by law.</strong></summary>

While TripSit welcomes users and communities from all ends of the spectrum, our network is not designed for nor aimed at children.

In accordance with the United States government and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, individuals under the age of 13 are not permitted to browse TripSit nor create user accounts.

We require (in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Act of 1998) that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before logging on, and to refrain from posting any information about themselves, personal or otherwise, on the network.

If you have collected information from or about a child under the age of 13, both parties will face a network ban.

</details>

# Accounts

## Nicknames or channels cannot be offensive
<details>
<summary><a href="/en/untagged/nicknames">Nicknames</a> and channels may not contain any racial slurs or bigotry.</summary>

In this case the user will be forced to choose another name, multiple offenses may result in bans.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Nickname suffixes cannot be disruptive to the community.</summary>

It's customary for users to post-pend their nickname with their current substance, to help others let them know that they're not sober.

For example, User1 may change his nick to User1|THC to show that they have ingested marijuana.

Users who choose to postpend disruptive words/phrases at the end of their nick will be asked to change it.

Examples of disruptive phrases are: Jenkem and krokodil.

Users who refuse to change their nick may have their nickname changed for them.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Abandoned accounts will be removed after a period of inactivity.</summary>

The administrators of TripSit reserve the right to delete any and all data associated with abandoned accounts including, but not limited to: Profile information entered by the user, channels owned by the user or blog posts made by the user.

| The bark and seeds of the African species Voacanga africana Stapf339 contain up to 10% indole alkaloids of the iboga type (cf. Tabernanthe iboga, ibogaine) and reportedly induce stimulating and hallucinogenic effects (Bisset 1985b; Oliver-Bever 1982, 8). The principal alkaloid is voacamine. African sorcerers are said to use the seeds to produce visions. In West Africa, the bark is utilized as a hunting drug and stimulant (Schuldes 1995, 77*). It also is regarded as a potent aphrodisiac. The bark of Voacanga bracteata Stapf is used in Gabon to get "high" (most likely as a marijuana substitute; cf. Cannabis indica). It contains 2.460/0 alkaloids (voacamine, voacamine-N-oxide, 20epi-voacorine, voacangine) that, although closely related to the compounds found in Tabernanthe iboga, apparently produce only mild depressant effects.(de Smet 1996, 145*; Puiseux et al. 1965). Voacanga dregei E. H. Mey. is also said to produce hallucinogenic effects (Schultes and Hofmann 1980, 366*). West African sorcerers ingest the seeds of Voacanga grandiflora (Miq.) Rolfe for visionary purposes. Unfortunately, the details of this use are still unknown, as the sorcerers keep their knowledge secret. | **Literature**<br><br>Bisset, N. G. 1985a.

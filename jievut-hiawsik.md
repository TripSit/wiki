| The Pima and 0'odham (= Papago) Indians both use the name jievut hiawsik, Â«earth flower;' to refer to lichens that live on rocks. One species, which unfortunately has not been identified botanically, exudes a strong scent, has an ashen gray color, and lives on rocks and old, dry wood. The lichen once had a religious significance. It was mixed with tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and smoked during the summer dances (cf. kinnikinnick). It is said to have an effect similar to that of marijuana (Cannabis indica) and to "make young men crazy." The Pima believe that a man can conquer any woman after he has smoked the lichen (Curtin 1984, 77). Until now, lichens have been almost completely unknown as psychoactive substances in ethnopharmacology (cf. Dictyonema). Recendy, beard lichens have found use as incense. | **Literature**<br><br>Curtin, 1. S. M. 1984. By the prophet ofthe earth: Ethnobotany ofthe Pima. Tucson: University of Arizona Press. |

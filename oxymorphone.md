**Oxymorphone** is a powerful semi-synthetic opioid analgesic. It's seven times more potent than morphine itself thus having a 0.4mg:10mg Morphine ratio. (Assuming 100% bioavailability with both substances)
Oxymorphone is found in three forms that are used in medical practice and what most of us would encounter if using the drug recreationally. 
Opana IR (Instant release) which is available in 5mg and 10mg tablets. 
Opana ER (Extended Release) Which is available in 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40mg tablets. (Generic Opana ER comes in 7.5mg and 15mg tablets)
Oxymorphone Ampoules which are very rare, but come as 1mg/ml. 
Because Oxymorphone is from the opioid family, users should experience major caution when using this substance for many days in a row, and also avoid mixing any other depressants when in use with them. (Some examples are Alcohol, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates and/or other opioids) 
Oxymorphone before the half of the old formulation it was commonly taken insufflated. Now with the addition of the new ER mechanism, users are either changing to a different substance, or they are using one of the methods used to break that ER mechanism. Which are very tedious and in my opinion not worth it, but you should be able to find a TEK online rather easily.  

## History

Oxymorphone was first developed in Germany in 1914. Then patented in the USA by Enda Pharmaceuticals in 1955. Which was then introduced to the United States in January of 1959, and other countries during the same time. It was designed to have a fewer side effects compared to Morphine and Heroin. 

## Dosage

Bioavailability of each route of administration. **Note: Do not take these dosages as dictionary. These are rough estimations off users' experience with it. Be safe and remember you can always take more, but you can never take less.**

Note that Opana contains much material which binds to mucous membranes in the nose, for this reason it is difficult to insufflate. 

Never inject a pill without a micron filter and a clean syringe.

## Harm Reduction

There has been some reports of a rare blood disease linked with intravenous injection since the new formulation (early 2012) came out. Read more about it [here](http://www.medpagetoday.com/Nephrology/GeneralNephrology/36819)

Like with all other opioids/opiates there is a chance of addiction and tolerance occurring with the use. Please keep that in mind if you plan on using this substance or any others in this class.

### Potentiators

* All First generation Anti-Histamines

* Alchohol

* Benzodiazapines

### Avoid

* All other CNS depressants (such as alcohol and benzodiazapines) as it could be too much sedation and you can overdose more easily.

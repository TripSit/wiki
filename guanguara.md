The Kogi Indians of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Colombia) call their coca hayo, a word that comes from the Tairona language. They distinguish three "species" of coca, each of which belongs to one of the tribes of the region. The Kamkuama tribe, which has now either disappeared or become extinct, cultivated a type of coca that had long leaves. The Kogi plant a variety with small leaves, and the Ika a type with tiny leaves (cf. Erythroxylum novogranatense). It is said that the ancestors, i.e., the Tairona, planted or harvested a tree named guangwira or guangwila in the paramos (high marshes) that had coca-like leaves with similar effects (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1985, 1:87*; Uscategui M. 1959, 281 f.*). Unfortunately, the botanical identification of this tree is unknown. It may simply have been another wild species of the genus Erythroxylum.

| This South African bush bears orange blossoms and is purported to have hallucinogenic effects (Schultes and Hofmann 1980, 367*). In Africa, it is known by the names dacha, daggha, and wild dagga, "wild hemp" (cf. Cannabis indica). The Hottentots (Khoikhoi; Heusaquas) and Bushmen smoke the buds and leaves as inebriants (Schleiffer 1979, 93 ff.*; Schuldes 1995, 48*). This bush may be one of the inebriating plants subsumed under the name kanna (cf. kanna, Mesembryanthemum spp., Sceletium tortuosum). The resinous leaves and the resin rubbed off or extracted from them are smoked either alone or mixed with tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) (Grubber 1991, 44*). In northern California, many people now smoke the leaves and orange flowers. Chemical studies are lacking (Ott 1993,411*). The rather bitter-tasting smoke of flowers grown in California has a mild psychoactive effect reminiscent of that of both Cannabis and Datura. In eastern South Africa, the closely related species Leonotis ovata is reportedly used for the same purpose (Schleiffer 1979,93*). Another closely related species, Leonotis nepetaefolia (1.) R. Br., is used in Caribbean folk medicine. The leaves and flowers of this species have yielded bound oils, bitter principles, diterpenes, coumarins, and resins (Argueta V. et al. 1994, 229*; Puroshothaman et al. 1974a, 1974b; Wong 1976, 136*). In Mexico, this plant is known as flor de mundo, "world flower;' or mota. The name mota is normally used to refer to marijuana (cf. Cannabis indica); this may indicate that the plant is used as a marijuana substitute. The extract of this plant has antispasmodic effects and appears to inhibit acetylcholine and histamine (Argueta V. et al. 1994,229*). | **Literature**<br><br>Puroshothaman, K.

**Other Names**

Harmaline: 4,9-dihydro-7-methoxy-1-methyl-3Hpyriol[3,4-b] indole, harmalin, harmalolmethylester, harmidin, harmidin, 3,4-dihydroharmin

Harmine: banisterin, banisterine, harmin, 7-methoxy-1-methyl-f3-carboline, telepathin, telepathine, yageine

Empirical formula: C13H14N20 (harmaline), C13H12N20 (harmine)

Substance type: f3-carbolines, harmala alkaloids (indole alkaloids)

Harmaline and harmine are found in Banisteriopsis caapi and Peganum harmala (Beringer 1928; Beringer 1929; Chen and Chen 1939). Harmine also occurs in numerous other plants (see [ayahuasca analogs](/en/ayahuasca-analogs)). Harmaline and harmine not only are strong MAO inhibitors (Pletscher et al. 1959; cf. f3-carbolines) but also have antibacterial properties (Ahmad et al. 1992). Harmine was an early treatment for Parkinson's disease (Halpern 1930b):

Harmine lessens the exaggerated excitability of the parasympathetic system in Parkinson's patients, increases the low excitability of the sympathetic system, also promotes the excitability of the vestibular apparatus, and puts the patient in a state of euphoria, helping them to better accept their affliction. (Roth et al. 1994, 548*)

In the 1960s, the Chilean psychiatrist Claudio Naranjo (1969*) introduced harmaline and harmine to psychotherapy as "fantasy-increasing drugs" (cf. [ibogaine](/en/ibogaine)). The extent to which these substances are psychoactive is questionable. To investigate the supposed "psychedelic" effect of harmine,

Maurer (together with Lamparter and Dittrich) tested the hypothesis that harmine is a hallucinogen in 11 self-experiments with a sublingual dosage between 25 and 750 mg. Contrary to expectations, however, harmine did not prove to be a substance that exhibited many similarities to classic hallucinogens such as [mescaline](/en/mescaline) or [psilocybin](/en/psilocybin). Maurer characterized the state that harmine induced as more of a retreat from one's surroundings and as a pleasant relaxation with a mildly reduced ability to concentrate. Short-term and elementary optic hallucinatory phenomena were observed only to the degree that they would otherwise also appear naturally during reduced contact with one's surroundings. With dosages above 300 mg, such undesirable vegetative and neurological symptoms as dizziness, nausea, and ataxia became more apparent, precluding any increase in dosage above 750 mg. (Leuner and Schlichting 1986, 170*)

Most experimenters have called into question the reports that Naranjo (1979*) published from his psychotherapeutic practice. It may be that he administered [ayahuasca](/en/ayahuasca), and not any pure substances, to his patients.

Today, harmaline and harmine are primarily used in the production of [pharmahuasca](/en/pharmahuasca) ([ayahuasca analogs](/en/ayahuasca-analogs)).

**Commercial Forms and Regulations**

Both substances are available through chemical suppliers. They may be purchased without restriction and are not subject to any legal regulations (Ott 1993,438*).

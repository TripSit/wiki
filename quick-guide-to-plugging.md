**Plugging** or rectal-administration is fairly popular among recreational drug users for many reasons; it can improve the absorption rate and bio-availability of some drugs, and can change the duration and onset dynamics of some drugs. When correctly executed the rectal ROA is preferable to some users for these reasons. It's also used professionally by doctors and veterinarians.

Plugging is an effective ROA, however there seems to be some ambiguity around how best to administer drugs rectally when not available in commercial suppositories.

## Equipment

Plugging requires some supplies, all of which (with the possible exception of a shot-glass or mixing container) should be readily available at your nearest pharmacy or drug-store. For oral syringes you may need to ask someone behind the pharmacy counter.

* An Oral Syringe
  * 3ml/5ml/10ml will all work fine
  * Oral Syringes are designed to be disposable. It is better practice to dispose oral syringes after one use, rather than risk infection or cross contamination. Plan ahead.
* Clean shot-glass or some small container to mix your solution in.
  * Usually glass is preferable but anything hydrophobic will work fine.
  * Use something smooth as porous surfaces can absorb some of your solution/substance.
* Lubricant
  * Preferably something water-based or KY-Jelly works fine. Avoid oil-based personal lubricants.
* Clean Water or otherwise appropriate solvent (see note below)
  * For polar compounds such as [MXE](/en/mxe), most opioids, [MDMA](/en/mdma), [Amphetamine](/en/amphetamine), etc it is best to use **water** as your plugging solvent since water is readily available and is easy to clean/purify.
  * For nonpolar compounds such as [DMT](/en/dmt), it is best to use **propylene glycol** since it is safe and relatively easy to obtain, is clean when purchased in a sealed container.

**Note:** In chemistry the term(s) 'polar' and 'nonpolar' are used to describe the state of a molecule's covalent bond; a polar substance will have an unbalanced covalent bond meaning it will have an excess charge, while 'non-polar' is used to differentiate between that and a substance which has a balanced covalent bond.

**For our intents and purposes you should understand that polar substances will not dissolve into a non-polar solvent. You can technically make a suspension using polar and nonpolar substances however it is recommended to use polar solvents for polar substances and vice-versa to ensure proper drug distribution and dose-control.**

## Preparation

Rectal drug administration itself is fairly simple to execute but does require some planning and preparation beforehand.
It should be noted that plugging anything caustic such as Ethylphenidate or 4-FA can and likely will result in some damage to the mucous membranes that line the rectum. This can cause some discomfort and may damage the rectal lining. Once you have gathered all the necessary equipment you will need to choose your dose and determine an appropriate amount of solution to use (usually 1-3ml is plenty, you want as little water as possible while still properly dissolving your dose)

For most substances which are commonly administered rectally the dosage is usually lower than it would be for the same substance if ingested orally or insufflated. Often the onset-duration dynamics change too, usually plugging results in a slightly longer delay with a faster onset. This is because changing the ROA changes the way a drug is metabolized and the rate at which it is absorbed.

Note: With many substances the plugging dose is close to insufflation dose for the same drug, however you should *always do your research on dosage when attempting rectal administration with any substance for the first time, and **when in doubt start small**.*

It is important to note that if you administer a solution or suspension rectally which is absorbed into feces it will not be effective! For this reason it is generally recommended to use your toilet before attempting to plug drugs or medicine. As such it is good practice to either think ahead a little bit or take into consideration your diet in the preceding ~12-24 hours as the state of your bowels will have a direct impact on the efficacy of this ROA.
Once you have determined an appropriate solvent its time to make your solution.

1. Take your clean hydrophobic container (shotglass, spoon, etc) and place your drug of choice in the container.
2. Draw an appropriate amount of your solvent into your oral syringe (1-5ml is usually plenty, depending on substance and solvent)
3. Slowly plunge the solvent into your container and onto your substance. You only want to use as much water as it takes to dissolve your drug fully and ideally no more. Once you've got enough solvent to work with use a clean stir stick of some sort (the back end of a clean spoon will do but a glass stir-stick is ideal) to mix your solution.
4. Once your substance is dissolved or evenly suspended plunge the remaining clean solvent from your oral syringe (if there is any extra that was not used to make your solution left.)
5. Insert the tip of your now empty oral-syringe into your newly made solution and slowly and evenly draw the solution into your syringe. Work on a flat surface and try to keep your oral syringe vertical for best results.
6. If any air is drawn into the syringe in the previous step, hold it with the tip facing upwards, flick the syringe to allow air to reach the top, and depress the plunger **slowly** to expel it.

## Application

Note: It is recommended to have another container of some sort to put your syringe into immediately after administration because you will need to lay down and wait for a few minutes and human feces can contain many pathogens and bacteria that can cause health problems if cross contaminated.
Apply lubricant liberally to your now full oral syringe to reduce resistance and discomfort.

1. Find a comfortable position to lay down in. Most users recommend laying on your side and lifting your upper leg as this position makes it easy to insert your oral syringe deeply and with less resistance than some alternatives.
2. Insert your oral syringe to a depth of around the distance from your 2nd or 3rd knuckle to the tip of your index or middle finger.
3. Administer your dose by slowly and steadily plunging the syringe. Keep it in place for about 30 seconds after you've finished plunging to allow all the liquid to disperse before removing the syringe.
4. Remove the syringe slowly to avoid removing any of the liquid accidentally
5. Once you have plunged and removed your oral syringe you should remain laying down for 5-15 minutes to allow the solution to absorb, ideally on your stomach or on your side. If you have prepared correctly you should have a container or bag nearby that can hold your oral syringe in the time it takes to allow the solution to be absorbed to avoid cross contamination.
6. Dispose of your syringe and wash your hands.

## Harm Reduction

* Plugging bypasses your first pass metabolism, and thus the initial filtering of the drug, and many of your body's defenses against overdose. Particularly with drugs such as alcohol, rectal administration can easily lead to overdose.

* Do not use ethanol as a solvent as it can damage the sensitive mucous membranes

* If a substance is caustic it is not recommended to administer rectally as it can cause damage to your rectal lining. If it hurts (or damages mucous membranes) to insufflate it will generally hurt/damage to plug!

* Rectal administration of substances does not make you gay, even if you get your buddy to help.

* It is strongly recommended to heat your solvent to room or body temperature prior to mixing and administering as plugging something colder than your body temperature can be very uncomfortable and slightly shocking.

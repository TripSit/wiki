## Harm Reduction

When on high doses of [benzodiazepines](/en/benzodiazepines), users are likely to black out and potentially hurt themselves through a variety of adventures. If you are using it as a sleep aid, it's recommended to continue doing what you're doing until you begin to feel drowsy, then go to bed.

Some users report Alprazolam (and [benzodiazepines](/en/benzodiazepines) in general) to lead to compulsive redosing, trying to find a "high" which is where a fair amount of the point above comes from. To avoid this keep doses low and be wary of reduced inhibitions while under the influence of Alprazolam.

### Interactions

As with other depressants, Alprazolam should not be combined with any other CNS depressants (such as [Alcohol](/en/alcohol)), at the risk of respiratory depression, which can lead to death.
See the [Drug combinations](/en/drug-combinations) chart for more information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Alprazolam is absorbed fairly rapidly, with peak plasma levels achieved around the one-two hour mark.

It is primarily metabilised via CYP3A4. Alprazolam is a chemical analogue of triazolam. It is a triazolobenzodiazepine. It binds to the GABA(a) receptor and modulates the function of the GABA receptor. You can learn more about the GABA(a) receptor [here](/en/gaba-receptors-and-subunits-info).

The LD50 of Alprazolam in rats is 331-2171mg/kg.

An Australian study (2004) of overdose admissions between 1987 and 2002 found alprazolam, which happens to be the most prescribed [benzodiazepine](/en/benzodiazepines) in the U.S. by a large margin, to be more toxic than [diazepam](/en/diazepam) and other [benzodiazepines](/en/benzodiazepines).

The genus Physalis is composed of some 120 species and is thus the largest genus of its family (Lu 1986, 80*). Several species are regarded as toxic, some are raised as ornamentals popular for their unusual flowers (Chinese lanterns), and others have ethnomedical significance. Physalis pubescens 1. and Physalis peruviana 1. (Cape gooseberry) are the two species most commonly grown for their fruit. Very mild toxic effects have been observed following consumption of a large number of berries of Physalis peruviana (Roth et al. 1994, 560*). The calyx, which surrounds the seeds like a lantern, can be smoked. It has definite psychoactive effects that tend to be narcotic in nature.

Physalis angulata 1., a species from the northwestern Amazon, is said to be mildly narcotic. Its juice finds use in Brazilian folk medicine as a treatment for earaches (Schultes and Raffauf 1991, 43*). Physalis minima, a species from the Caroline Islands known as poowa, bears fruits that are said to have an inebriating effect when consumed in excess (von Reis Altschul 1975, 269*).

The roots of some species of the genus have yielded tropane alkaloids as well as alkaloids of the hygrine type (von Reis Altschul 1975, 269*). The Jew's cherry or lampion flower, Physalis alkekengi 1. (cf. halicacabon), contains the mildly toxic bitter principlesphysaline A, B, and C (Roth et al. 1994, 560*).

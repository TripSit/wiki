In Peru, Pedilanthus retusus Benth. is known locally as misha. This name is typically used as a folk taxonomic catchall for the various angel's trumpets (Brugmansia spp.) but is also occasionally given to other psychoactive plants (cf. Lycopodium spp., cimora). At the Institute for Traditional Medicine in Lima, it is claimed that Pedilanthus retusus is a potent hallucinogen, for it is said to contain a substance similar to mescaline.

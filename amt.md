**α-Methyltryptamine** is a long-lasting euphoric stimulant and a psychedelic, a research chemical which was first discovered in the 60s.

## History

It was originally developed in the USA in the 60s by the Upjohn company during research into anti-depressants, and the alpha-ethylated homologue became available as a commercial anti-depressant in the US (under the name Monase). However, αMT itself was available during the 60s for use as an anti-depressant in 5 and 10mg doses in the Soviet Union, sold under the brand name Indopan.

As with many research chemicals, it was examined by Alexander Shulgin and details of its effects and synthesis were described in the book TiHKAL. Both during his own experiences noted in the entry, and in his further notes drawing from the experiences of others he concludes that the chemical seems to have a wide variation in many of its properties between users and even individual experiences - particularly in effects and onset.

It was one of the first 'research chemicals' which became widely available on the Internet during the 1990s, and as a result became illegal in the USA in 2003. The drug remained relatively obscure up until this point, though it was used in certain psychotherapeutic studies during the 60s, and there are some reports which suspect recreational use took place as early as the 1960s, as a result of the chemical supply for these studies being diverged.

With the rising popularity of research chemical use on the Internet during the 21st century, it has seen increasing levels of use - and while it remains legal in most countries in the world recent efforts have been made by certain governments to illegalize it.

## Harm Reduction

As a [stimulating](/en/stimulants) psychedelic, it carries a heavy body load, and care must be taken to observe physical side-effects such as vasoconstriction, which increase rapidly with dose. Toxic effects have been described at larger doses, so care must be taken to dose accurately.

Many users report experiencing particular nausea when ingesting the drug, which is abated after vomiting. If you feel the need to vomit, do not fight it.

Avoid other [MAOIs](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/maois/maois_info3.shtml).

See [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](/en/psychedelics#harm-reduction) for general information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

αMT acts as a relatively balanced reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of the main three monoamines; serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist.

αMT is a reversible MAOI in higher doses (the danger rises exponentially as αMT doses approach 150 mg due to increased monoamine release and increased MAO inhibition), can cause Serotonin Syndrome when combined with monoamine releasers, [SSRIs](/en/antidepressants#ssris) or other MAO inhibitors.

## Legal Status

αMT is scheduled in the US, Australia, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece,

Hungary, Japan, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and soon in the UK as well.

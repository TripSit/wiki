| Also known as memory root, dragon root is reputed to have hallucinogenic effects (Schultes and Farnsworth 1982, 187*; Schultes and Hofmann 1980,366*). There are several potently toxic plants in the Family Araceae (e.g., Arum, Dieffenbachia, Dracunculus) as well as such questionable hallucinogens as sweet flag (Acorus calamus) (cf. Plowman 1969). The genus Arisaema is known for its allergenic effects when touched or eaten. Fruits and other parts of the plant contain microscopically small needles of crystallized calcium oxalate, contact with which can lead to heavy histamine secretion (Turner and Szczawinski 1992, 116*). The homeopathic agent Arum dracontium hom. is obtained from the flowers of this plant. The Ojibwa Indians are said to have used the root to counteract witchcraft (Moerman 1982, 101 *). The related species Arum maculatum 1. was used as a wine additive (cf. Vitis vinifera). | **Literature**<br><br>Plowman, Timothy. 1969. Folk uses of New World aroids.

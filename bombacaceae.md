| The genus Quararibea consists of some twentynine species (Schultes 1957, 249). In Mexico, the aromatic leaves ("cacao flowers") of the small tree Quararibea funebris (La Llave) Vischer [syn. Lexarza funebris La LIave, Myrodia funebris Benth.] are used as a spice for cacao drinks (see [Theobroma cacao](/en/theobroma-cacao)) (Rosengarten 1977; Schultes 1957). They have been described as a possible hallucinogen and also have been identified as the mysterious Aztec inebriant poyomatli. According to Jonathan Ott, who has experimented with these flowers as well as cacao preparations containing them, Quararibea flowers are not psychoactive (Ott 1993, 418*). However, several interesting substances are present (Î³-butyrolactones, alkaloids) that may indeed have psychotropic effects (Raffauf and Zennie 1983). The Peruvian inebriant espingo, which has not been clearly identified, has also been interpreted as the fruit of a Quararibea species. In Amazonia, Quararibea species are used as [ayahuasca](/en/ayahuasca) additives and they are also added to Peruvian San Pedro preparations (see [Trichocereus pachanoi](/en/trichocereus-pachanoi)). The Kofan Indians use Quararibea putumayensis Cuatr. in the manufacture of arrow poisons (Ott 1993,418*). | **Literature**<br><br>Raffauf, Robert E, and Thomas M. Zennie. 1983.

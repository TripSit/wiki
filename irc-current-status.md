As of writing this article, the IRC-Server under irc.tripsit.me is only accessible for users with a previously registered and active NickServ-Identity.

The connection to the IRC-Server is established using SASL-Authentication.

On the IRC-Server, you'll find a bunch of channels which are all bridged to discord, as our community is currently hosted there.

The reason for this change is that the IRCd became unmaintainable over the past years.

We're planning to expand to other services besides Discord, possibly we will also self-host *something* again.

If you have any questions or want to contribute in any way, you're super welcome to reach out to us. You can join our Discord guild [here](https://discord.gg/tripsit) or fire an [email](mailto://tripsit@tripsit.me)

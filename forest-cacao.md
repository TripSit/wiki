| This small tree, also known as cedro ajua, huapa, pucuna huapa ("blowpipe huapa"), or sacha cacao ("forest cacao"), provides a resin that is used in the manufacture of snuff. It may be psychoactive. Active substances have not yet been detected (Ott 1993, 409*). <br><br> The Amazonian Indians (Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil) produce a snuff from Iryanthera macrophylla (Benth.) Warb. that may be psychoactive. One analysis found 5-MeO-DMT in this plant material (Schultes 1985, 131); later studies have been unable to confirm this (Ott 1993, 409*). <br><br> The Bora and Witoto formerly used Iryanthera ulei Warb. as an oral hallucinogen. 5-MeO-DMT has also been found in the bark of this plant. <br><br> Iryanthera longiflora Ducke is said to be a hallucinogen as well (Davis and Yost 1983, 186*). | **Literature** <br><br> Schultes, Richard Evans. 1985.

This document is a simple reference and agreement between staff members, that will ensure we are working towards TripSit's goals in all aspects of our composure on the network.

## Summary

1. TripSit is a harm reduction (HR) community with a focus on positivity and inclusiveness.
2. Staff members are representatives of the network and its goals.
3. For the purpose of ensuring our continuing excellence in meeting these goals, staff agree to:
   1. Use communication before commands to diffuse issues whenever possible.
   2. Understand that there's a chance that the person(s) you're interacting with may be in an altered mindset, and that's okay. Be understanding of that fact, and offer to talk to them when they're more clear-headed.
   3. Likewise, if you're on a substance, that's fine too. Just pay attention to when you need to step back and let others take over, or when you need to approach a subject at a later time. Try to avoid moderating while on a substance that may alter or impair your decision making skills.
   4. Recognise gaps in your knowledge and seek expert input from others. Talk to the team or seek additional input if you are unsure. Even if you are sure, be receptive when other team members correct errors in your understanding.
   5. Bring in additional staff for input or backup, if an event is frustrating to the point you're getting angry, or if it involves a personal relationship that may cloud your judgement. Nothing on IRC should upset you to the point of anger.
   6. Regardless of our views on controversial topics, not to undertake in discrimination on the basis of our views in these areas. Likewise, we should defer to another staff member if our personal views on a topic impede our ability to deal with a situation fairly.
      1. e.g. Trump supporters are people too, discussing Trump (a controversial topic) is fine but dehumanizing others is not.
      2. When we say that we do not discriminate, we mean that our role is to apply the rules depending on people's behaviour and actions, not their beliefs.
      3. This does not mean that we ignore abusive opinions or discussions, only that we do not let our individual beliefs affect our judgement when acting as moderators.
   7. Act as a role model for the kinds of behaviour we wish to see from our users.

## Mission

TripSit (TS) is a harm reduction (HR) community. Our chat network and other resources exist for the purpose of providing an open discussion of HR-grounded drug use. We believe that by providing a forum in which people can openly discuss drug-related matters, coupled with a strong promotion of HR techniques and the provision of positive support, we can reduce uninformed and reckless drug use, and the harm that naturally entails.

Our role as staff members is to support, develop, and facilitate this environment. This is a guiding principle, and the question of â€ždoes this support TripSit's mission?" may be applied to any staff behaviour or conduct to discern the right action.

## Representation

Staff members officially represent our organisation, and their actions reflect our core values. Our staff are the driving force for interaction and harm reduction in the community, and so have the power to influence many users of the network through their behaviour. Because of this, all staff members should express themselves with integrity and respect. Users take their cues for how to act based on how staff members act, and so we aim to act as positive influences on users.

In instances of articles, videos, blogs, public complaints, or appeals about TripSit being published staff should inform the team via #teamtripsit but refrain from making public comments on behalf of TripSit. Please also consider comments made in a personal capacity reflect on TripSit due to your position on the team. Comments should be discussed and agreed by upper staff.

## Communication

All of our users are people, and deserve to be treated with respect. In most cases, users are reasonable and will respond well to being spoken directly with. We should attempt this, before applying stronger methods of moderation.
We should also strive to discuss our actions with other staff members, and encourage constructive criticism and questioning of our actions. In this way, we can avoid making mistakes, and work towards better management of our community.

We acknowledge that disagreements between staff happen. However, arguing in public channels about disagreements is not appropriate; 
such discussions should take place in #teamtripsit or #moderators as appropriate. This serves the purpose of not undermining another staff member in front of the users. We may all interpret situations or rules differently. Remember that we are a team and we need to work together as one. As such, discussions should be undertaken in a respectful manner, remembering not to confuse the issue at hand for any personal issues i.e. working together to solve the issue at hand, rather than simply to win an argument with another staff member. If staff members cannot resolve a dispute on their own, they need to ask for feedback from another more senior staff member.

## Conflict of Interest

Since our staff members are well-integrated members of the community, it is not unusual for a  situation to involve a community-member that staff have a personal relationship with. We should apply rules fairly regardless of these relationships, and in some cases it may be better to ask another staff member to deal with the situation. We should also feel safe suggesting to another staff member that their personal relationship with a user may make it more appropriate for somebody else to handle the situation.

## Improper Conduct

While we aim to adhere to the code of conduct in all facets of our behaviour on the network, we understand that sometimes staff may fall short in this endeavour. Infractions of the code of conduct are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, tending in most cases towards a corrective conversation with an upper staff member in an informal manner. However, repeated, intentional, or more serious behavioural digressions may result in greater disciplinary action (such as a formal warning), or in serious cases removal from the staff team.

| **Folk Names** | **Artifacts** |
|----------------|---------------|
| Asselkaktus, falscher peyote, false peyote, hatchet cactus, peotillo, peyote (see [Lophophora williamsii](/en/lophophora-williamsii)), peyote meco, peyotillo, piote | See [Lophophora williamsii](/en/lophophora-williamsii). |

| **History** | **Medicinal Use** |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Indians of northern Mexico once used this relatively rare cactus in a similar manner to or as a substitute for peyote (see [Lophophora williamsii](/en/lophophora-williamsii)). The first botanical description of the psychoactive cactus was made by the Berlin physician and botanist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (1795-1876). A powder of the cactus was formerly sold in Paris under the name poudre de peyote, "peyote powder." | See [Lophophora williamsii](/en/lophophora-williamsii). |

| **Distribution** | **Constituents** |
|------------------|------------------|
| This cactus occurs only in northern Mexico (San Luis Potosi) (Preston-Mafham 1995, 167*; Zander 1994,422*). | The cactus contains hordenine, anhalidine, pellotine, 3-dimethyltrichocerine, some mescaline, N-methylmescaline, and other p-phenethylamines (Mata and McLaughlin 1982, 110*; Neal et al. 1972). |

| **Cultivation** | **Effects** |
|-----------------|-------------|
| The plant is propagated from seeds, which are planted in the same manner as those of [Lophophora williamsii](/en/lophophora-williamsii). | One cactus, eaten fresh, is said to produce peyote-like effects (cf. [Lophophora williamsii](/en/lophophora-williamsii)). Although the effects are not quite as dramatic, they do include the typical visual changes and phenomena (William Emboden, pers. comm.). |

| **Appearance** | **Commercial Forms and Regulations** |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| This solitary cactus can grow to a height of 10 cm. It has a round form with lateral, flattened tubercles that are arranged in a spiral fashion and have scalelike pectinate spines. Because of this, the cactus sometimes resembles a deeply convoluted brain. The flowers are up to 3 cm across and are bright violet. The fruits are red pods. Peyotillo can easily be confused with the closely related species Pelecyphora strobiliformis (Werderm.) Kreuz. [syn. Ariocarpus strobiliformis Werderm., Encephalocarpus strobiliformis (Werderm.) Berger; cf. [Ariocarpus fissuratus](/en/ariocarpus-fissuratus)], which is found in Nuevo Leon (Mexico) (Preston-Mafham 1995, 167*). Another very similar species is Pelecyphora pseudopectinata Backeb. [syn. Neolloydia pseudopectinata (Backeb.) Anderson, Turbinicarpus pseudopectinatus (Backeb.) Glass et Foster]; in Tamaulipas, this cactus is also called peyote (Diaz 1979, 90*). Turbinicarpus valdezianus (Moell.) Glass et Foster [syn. Pelecyphora valdezianus Moell.] is also quite similar, but it is smaller (growing to a height of only 2.5 cm) and occurs in Coahuila (Preston-Mafham 1995, 194*). | This rare cactus is almost never found in the international cactus trade. It may be possible to obtain seeds from ethnobotanical mail-order suppliers. |

There is a sacred mountain in Iran known as KohiGabr, "mountain of the fire worshippers." In ancient Persia, before the advent of Islam, the fire worshippers were the people who would ritually drink haoma (cf. [Peganum harmala](/en/peganum-harmala)). A ruin at the peak of the mountain is thought to once have been a Zoroastrian fire temple (cf. [Ephedra spp.](/en/ephedra-spp)):

Concentrated magical essence has remained in this place, and an army of especially gifted genies dwells there. It is said that the "power" causes people who wish to approach the spot to shrink back. . . . Stories relate how those who climbed Kohi returned as madmen or cripples or wasted away. (1. Shah 1994, 153*)

We do not know what really transpired on this mountain. But it was associated both with other places of power and with certain psychoactive substances:

Not far from this place, there are other mountains that are also linked to magical concepts. Here the fire-worshipping magicians once made offerings of fruit to placate certain spirits and to entice them into captivity so that they would obey their commands. Anyone who wanted to have a wish fulfilled would write it down and place it in a bowl filled with fruit, which the magicians would then take up the mountain. At the peak of one such mountain grew the tobo tree, the tree of eternal bliss. It is said to resemble the tree that stands at the right side of Allah in paradise. Good fairies carry the great sufferings and fears to this place, where they are purified so that the sufferers will be freed from their afflictions. (I. Shah 1994, 153 f.*)

The tobo tree is presumably some type of psychoactive plant that was identified with the tree of knowledge.

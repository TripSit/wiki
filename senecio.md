| Many species of this genus, which encompasses some 1,300 species and is found throughout the world, are said to be psychoactive (Schultes and Farnsworth 1982, 188*; Schultes and Hofmann 1992, 56*) or are at least associated with psychoactive plants or preparations (see [Lophophora williamsii](/en/lophophora-williamsii), [Trichocereus pachanoi](/en/trichocereus-pachanoi)). The Mexican species Senecio cardiophyllus Hemsl. is even referred to as peyote (Martinez 1994,384*). Many Senecio species are used in South America as ritual incense (Aldunate et al. 1981*). In the Andes regions, they are known as cundur-cundur and appear to be mythologically associated with the condor, an animal sacred to the Indians. A Senecio species known as chula-chula is chewed together with coca (see [Erythroxylum coca](/en/erythroxylum-coca)). Many Senecio species contain alkaloids of the pyrrolizidine type (Roder and Wiedenfeld 1977; Schultes and Hofmann 1992, 56*). Cyanoglycosides have also been found (Schultes 1981, 43*). The alkaloid jacobine, together with other pyrrolizidines, passes into the honey that is produced from these plants (Frohne and pfander 1983,66*). In Nepal, various yellow-blooming crucifers are used as ritual offerings. A psychoactive use is unknown. | **Literature** Roder, Erhard, and Helmut Wiedenfeld. 1977.

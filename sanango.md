**Synonyms**

Gomara racemosa RUlz et Pav., Gomaranthus racemosus (R. et P.) Rauschert, Sanango durum Bunting et Duke

This rare and mysterious bush is related to Desfontainia spinosa. It is found in the rain forests of Amazonia at altitudes up to 100 meters (Brako and Zarucchi 1993, 619*) and is endemic to Peru (Gentry 1993, 564*). The leaf is used as an inebriant. Reports circulate of its wondrous effects. However, there have been few ethnopharmacological investigations into this promising plant.

This tree, a relative of the cashew (Anacardium occidentale 1.), can grow as tall as 18 meters. It supposedly is or was consumed in South Africa for its inebriating properties (Lewin 1980 [orig. pub. 1929], 297*). It is possible that marula was the kanna plant or one of the plants known as kanna (Schultes and Farnsworth 1982, 174*). The closely related species Sclerocarya schweinfurthiana Schinz. has also been characterized as psychoactive (Lewin 1980, 297*; Schultes and Farnsworth 1982, 187*). Constituents are unknown (Emboden 1979, 191*).

## Organisational Structure

Aside from primary staff positions, we organise ourselves based on a tree.

### Concepts

#### Trunk
* Base of the team, responsible for making sure everything is running okay.
* reality, Teknos, SevenCats

#### Branches
* "Projects" or "teams" that work on their own objectives.
* Branch leaders report to admins on the status of projects and direct their team (leaves) on how to proceed.

#### Leaves
* Staff who work on projects with their branch leaders.

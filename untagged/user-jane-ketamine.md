## Preparation of injectable ketamine solution from "street" ketamine

It is assumed that ketamine provided is simply the evaporated shards of veterinary-grade ketamine (e.g., Ketalar, Ketaset, etc). These instructions do not cover "extraction" of ketamine from non-ketamine-containing mixtures. Additionally, the assumed route of administration here is intramuscular, not intravenous; intravenous solutions can have a higher concentration of ketamine per ml.

### Materiel

* Sterile saline solution
* Ketamine powder or "shards"
* Benzyl alcohol
* Sterile 10ml multi-dose vials
* Septums ("tops") per each multi-dose vial
* Sterile glass stirring rods
* Sterile beaker or graduated cylinder of greater than 50ml capacity
* Sterile syringe filters (22μm)
* Sterile 20cc syringes
* Temperature-controlled hot plate with magnetic stirring device or glass stirring rods, above

### Preparation

Ketamine is quite soluble in water up to about 200mg/ml when warm and closer to 100mg/ml at room temperature.

1. To begin, measure out one gram (1g) of ketamine per 10ml of saline solution used. Heat water in the beaker or cylinder to 80°C.
2. Add ketamine powder to the heated water.
3. Stir using a glass stirring rod or magnetic stirring device.
4. When powder is visibly dissolved in the sterile solution, meter out 10ml of the solution using a 20cc syringe per 10ml vial.
5. Using the 22μm syringe filter, add 10ml of the ketamine solution per multi-dose vial.
6. Per 10ml, measure out .1ml of benzyl alcohol (1%), and dispense to each multi-dose vial.
7. Apply septum to each multi-dose vial and allow solution to cool to at most 30°C.

### Notes on usage

Always use a test injection of e.g., 1/10th cc (in this case, 10mg) before actually using a therapeutic or recreational dose.

Benzyl benzoate may be used instead of benzyl alcohol at 1-2% per volume as a preservative/antimicrobial agent.

Ketamine is highly soluble at room- and body temperature. That said, for intramuscular injection, it is very important to ensure the solution will not "crash" (come out of solution) post-injection because of the solution cooling. Under no circumstances should you prepare a solution of greater than 100mg/ml or inject a solution that is above body temperature.

With benzyl alcohol or benzyl benzoate, in sterile sealed vials, having been processed through a syringe filter, and kept above freezing, this solution should remain quite stable and sterile indefinitely.

RU-24,969 - Selective HT1A & B Agonist
Indorenate - Anxiolytic HT Agonist 1A,B 2C

## 5-HT1a

This receptor is involved in neuromodulation. Agonists decrease heart rate and blood pressure, release Norepinephrine and show efficacy in anxiolysis, antidepression, analgesia and antiemetic effects, the latter two via inhibition of the NK1 receptor (Neurokinin 1). Agonism also causes serotonin modulation and vice versa; SRI's, SRA's and MOAI's activate the HT1a receptor. Dopamine release has also been found upon agonism of HT1a, contradictory to this however, agonism impairs certain aspects of memory and learning by inhibiting the release of glutamate and acetylcholine, thus some antagonists such as lecozotan have been shown to be novel treatments for Alzheimer's.

Other effects of 5-HT1a activation include; Decreased aggression, Increased sociability, Decreased impulsivity, Inhibition of drug-seeking behavior, Facilitation of sex drive and arousal, Inhibition of penile erection, Diminished food intake, Prolongation of REM sleep latency and Reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression. Has also been shown to interact with BDNF, whether increasing or decreasing it's expression within the brain.

## HT1B

In the frontal cortex it is responsible for inhibiting the release of dopamine, in the basal ganglia and striatum, 5-HT inhibits the release of serotonin and decreases glutamatergic transmission and in the Hippocampus it produces a facilitation in excitatory synaptic transmission which is altered in depression. Outside the brain, activation can cause pulmonary vasoconstriction. Knockout mice lacking the 5-HT1B gene show an increase in aggression and a higher preference for alcohol.

CP-94,253 - Potent and selective HT1b agonist. Promotes wakefulness, antidepression and enhances cocaine by increasing dopamine release.
SB-216,641 - Selective HT1b antagonist, has anxiolytic properties.

## HT1D

Acts on the CNS and affects locomotion and anxiety. It also induces vascular vasoconstriction in the brain.

5-(Nonyloxy)tryptamine - Selective HT1d agonist (1.0nM)
BRL-15,572 - Selective HT1d antagonist useful in finding the role of HT1d. HT1d seems to modulate release of glutamate and regulates cerebral blood pressure, making agonists effective migraine cures.

## HT1E

Function UNKNOWN. Hypothesised that it plays a large role in regulation of memory. This receptor is also not found in animals.

BRL-54443 - Selective agonist for HT1e & f. Only known (partially) selective ligand.

## HT1F

Lasmiditan - Selective HT1f agonist used in treatment of migraines. Lack of affinity for other receptors like HT1b&d may result in fewer vasoconstriction related side effects

Medifoxamine - DRI & HT2A & C agonist. hepatotoxic.
Oxaflozane - HT1A,2A,2C Agonist
Synephrine - strong a1 agonist, non selective adrenergic and HT2A

## HT2A

HT2A agonism doesn't automatically mean the compound will be psychedelic. 6-Fl-DET is inactive as a psychedelic despite agonising HT2a. The same occurs in Lisuride, an ergoloid derivative. Lisuride has high affinity for D2,3&4, HT1a,2a&c but lacks psychedelic affect. This suggests that there are various genes (GPCR oligomers) encoded into the HT2a receptor and while a less selective ligand such as LSD can connect with these receptors (specifically MGluR-2), some cannot and display no psychedelic effects. This suggests that in future, compounds will be able to access these more selective sites to shape the affect of the drug.

## HT2B

- CNS Presynaptic Inhibition - meaning agonism causes serotonin to be released. HT2B inhibited mice were void of MDMA-induced hyperlocomotion and 5-HT release.
- Pulmonary vasoconstriction - agonism caused
- HT2B regulates cardiac function. In failing human heart conditions, HT2B receptors were way overexpressed than usual.
- Modulates serotonin release and protects against serotonin syndrome even if agonised.

## HT2C

Significantly regulate mood, anxiety, feeding and reproducing by regulating dopamine release in multiple areas of the brain. Antagonism increases dopamine release however. Therefore the agonism of HT2C contributes to depression and anxiety. In fact suicide victims usually have an abnormally high amount of HT2C receptors present in the prefrontal cortex.

## HT3

Full agonism however causes nausea and vomiting, anxiety and higher propensity of seizure rate. Similarly full antagonism causes convulsions and anxiety. Agonists also produce nociceptinergic excitation, possibly having effects of addiction and withdrawal.

YM-31636 - Selective HT3 agonist, increases colonic mobility but does not induce diarrhea.

Ondanestron - Selective HT3 antagonist used as an antiemetic for cancer patients. While having no affinity for any other D or HT receptors, Ondanestron has proved useful in treating schizophrenia. It also has found use as withdrawal and craving reducer for alcohol and opioids.
Thujone - Active ingredient in Absinthe. Acts as a HT3 antagonist and GABA-A antagonist, resulting in convulsions and paranoia.

## HT-4

Indeloxazine* - S releaser, DRI, NMDA antag., acetylcholine releaser
PRX-03140 - Partial HT4 agonist developed for Alzheimer's.
RS-67,333 - Potent partial HT4 agonist as well as being a sigma-1 ligand. Possesses antidepressant and nootropic properties.
SL65.0155 * - Selective partial HT4 agonist. Enhances cognition, learning, memory and has antidepressant effects. Was in phase II trials then abandoned??

## HT-5a

5-HT5b is non functional in humans
HT-5a functions as an agonist by negatively influencing cAMP levels via Giα & Goα receptors.

SB-742,457 * - Potent, selective antagonist of HT6, with cognition, memory and learning enhancing effects. Currently under phase II trials.

## 5-HT7

The HT-7 receptor is coupled with the Gs proteines, stimulating cAMP levels. It also plays a role in smooth muscle relaxation within the vasculature and in the gastrointestinal tract. As a result the HT-7 receptor is involved with thermoregulation, circadian rhythm, learning and memory, sleep and mood regulation.

I wish people would spend as much time tweaking / Improving their brains, as they do with planning todays outfit, makeup, hair. Whilst their brains and insides rot.. 
You get the idea.

We can hope :) Thanks to website's like this.. I have hope.

I'm a mind explorer, mind improver and mind centric. 

The brain, the outer universe, and the inner. What could be more inspiring.

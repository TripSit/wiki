Cyclopropylmescaline, also known as CPM and 4-cyclopropylmethoxy-3, Is a relatively unknown psychedelic hallucinogenic drug created by Alexander Shulgin. It was tested at 70 and 80 mg and had varied effects from dose to dose. Inability to sleep was a common problem on both drugs, and like many hallucinogenics there were effects such as enhanced appreciation for music and art, discussion of philosophy etc... .

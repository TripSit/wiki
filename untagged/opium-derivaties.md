## OPIUM DERIVATIVES

**OPIUM ALKALOIDS**

Thebaine - 6, 14 dimethoxy version of OM. Stimulant rather than analgesic, high dose causes OD

**ALKALOID SALT MIXTURES**

Pantopon - Preparation of all alkaloids present in opium without plant matter. Injectable and almost as potent as morphine.

**MORPHINE FAMILY**

6-MDDM - 80x potency of M, faster onset and less body load

Azidomorphine - 40x potency of M with high affinity to μ

Hydromorphinol - Derivative of M but more potent, with a steeper dose-response curve and a longer half life. Script in Sweden.

Methyldesorphin - 15x potency of M. Is found in Krokodil

Morphinan-6-one (MR-2096) - OM analogue at roughly 5-7mg dosage. RC. FULL NAME: (N-tetrahydrofurfuryl)noroxymorphone

N-Phenethylnormorphine - 8-14x potency of M.

RAM-378* - N-Phenethyl analogue of Hydromorphinol. It is probably more potent as a result.

**3, 6 MORPHINE DIESTERS**

Diacetyldihydromorphine - Occasionally used an alternative to diamorphine, of which it is faster acting, longer lasting and has less side effects such as euphoria and addiction. However it is equipotent with morphine.

Dipropanoylmorphine - Ester of M used to treat severe pain. Rarely used but considered to be safer and less adictive than M. As such carries less side effects, such as euphoria. Slower acting, longer lasting and slightly more potent than M.

Nicomorphine - 2-3x the potency of M and commonly prescribed in German speaking countries

**CODEINE-DIONINE FAMILY**

Heterocodeine - Reverse isomer of codeine. 6x potency of M, while Codeine is a prodrug, HC is a direct agonist.

Produces convulsions at high doses and reverses respiratory depression produced by μ agonism. Also protects heart muscle cells from death during oxygen deprivation, a result of heart attacks.

## OTHERS

3-HO-TCP - PCP analogue. More glutamergic than the PCP analogue.

3-HO-BCP - substitutes for both cocaine and morphine at ~5mg (made-up)

AD-1211 - Structure looks unrelated to /most/ other opioid drugs. Mixed Agonist-antagonist at opioid recepts similar to pentazocine. Little to no developement of tolerance/dependence in animal studies.

AH-7921 - Selective μ agonist, with 80% potency of M. distributed as an RC, TRs show that it has very little euphoria, indicating euphoria comes from somewhere else. Perhaps sigma? Other opioids are heavily potentiated by it. Perhaps μ agonism is purely analgesic and high comes from a combination of μ & δ with each multiplying the affect of the other. This indicates ultimate opiate high would be moderately selective δ agonist

Azaprocin - Azaprocin - ~10x potency of M. Faster onset and short duration of actin. Discoved in 1963, never been marketed. The derivative subbed on the phenyl ring with a p-nitro group would be more potent by roughly 2.5. (So 25x potency of M) The open ringed 2,6-dimethylpiperazine analouges would also be active.

C-8813 (Thiobromadol) - 591x potency of M. μ agonist & δ antagonist to reduce repiratory depression. Making the drug safer.

Ciramadol - Opioid related to PCP, Tramadol & Tapentadol. mixed ant.-ag. for μ, low abuse potential and ceiling on respiratory depression.

Enadoline - Highly selective κ agonist. Produces visual distortions, dissociation and of course dysphoria similar to Salvia.

Herkinorin - Analogue of Salvinorin A but the complete opposite. 100x higher μ affinity and 50x lower κ affinity. Also; "does not promote the recruitment of β-arrestin-2 to the intracellular domain of the μ-opioid receptor, or induce receptor internalization". This means Herkinorin may not produce tolerance or dependance.

HZ-2 - κ-opioid agonist, same potency as morphine, long duration, high oral BA

ICI-199,441 - high potency, highly selective κ agonist with analgesic effects

Methopholine - Isoquinilone derivative with same efficacy as codeine. Could produces corneal opacity. Analogues are more potent with 4'-nitromethopholine at 20x codeine.

Nortilidine - Equipotency of M. Opioid activity is in (1S,2R) iso, NMDA antagonism is in (1R,2S) iso. Also acts as a DRI.

O-Desmethyltramadol - metabolite of Tramadol. Considerably more potent than Tramadol. Both (+) & (-) isomers lose SRI function but (-) retains NRI functionality. RC.

Salvinorin A - Highly potent κ agonist and even more potent D2 partial agonist. Use in therapy for addiction.

Salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether - semi-synthetic analogue of Salv. A. Longer duration @ ~3hrs, active at 50ug & 3000x (!) selectivity over μ & δ

Salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether - Similar to ^^ but less selective. 5x potency as Salvinorin A. Deacetylised from Salvinorin A.

SC-17599 - selective μ agonist with little or no affinity for δ & κ. Potency in between pethidine & morphine.

RWJ-394674 - potent and selective δ agonist, however once inside body it is dealkylated to its monodesethyl metabolite RWJ-413216 which is a potent μ agonist with less affinity for δ. δ activity counteracts the respiratory depression the μ causes. Only prominent side effect is sedation (and euphoria!)

TAN-67 - potent and selective δ1 agonist. Has analgesic properties & releases dopamine in the brain. Neuro & cardiac protective properties.

Tapentadol - μ & σ agonist & SNRI. Potency in between M & Tram.

Tifluadom - Benzo derivative but without GABAa agonism. Instead selective κ agonism.

U-50488 - highly selective κ agonist with analgesic effects

U-69,593 - Potent and selective κ1 agonist. Produces; antinociception, anti-inflammation, anxiolysis (low doses), respiratory depression & diuresis. Also inhibits periphery oxytocin secretion. Not sure if hallucinogenic.

W-15 - 5.4x Morphine. RC.

W-18 - 10,000x potency of M, structure abstract from any other drug. These super potent opioids are used in vetenarian practice for tranquilising elephants.

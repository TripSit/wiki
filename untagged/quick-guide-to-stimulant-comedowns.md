# Stimulant Comedowns

This article is a quick guide to stimulant comedowns including common symptoms, how to avoid them and how to deal with them.

## Symptoms of Stimulant Comedowns

The symptoms of stimulant comedowns will be affected by the drug used as well as the intensity and length of use. With certain chemicals a particularly harsh comedown may also include withdrawal symptoms, due to a chemical addiction having formed during the period of use.

### Common Effects of Stimulant Comedowns

* Inability to sleep
* Inability to concentrate
* Unhappiness, low mood
* Lack of appetite
* Muscle problems, including (but not limited to):
  * Muscle tension
  * Clenching
  * Restless legs
  * Twitching
  * Shaking
* Urge to redose

### Symptoms of Advanced Stimulant Comedowns

After a longer or heavier period of abuse (a binge), the above effects will be intensified and lengthened and may begin to include the following:

* Mood swings
* Psychosis
* Hallucinations

## How to Mitigate Stimulant Comedowns

Many of the symptoms of a stimulant comedown are caused by the user not having looked after their body during a binge, since the effects of the drug make the user feel as if they don't have to do so. Therefore, you can actually mitigate or even entirely avoid a lot of ill effects by observing a few basic guidelines during the period of use:

* Keep hydrated
* Eat healthy food regularly. Cereal bars, crackers and dry cereal are generally easy to consume.
* Get some sleep every night (even if you aren't able to enter deep sleep, a period of rest for the body is very beneficial)
* Dose moderation
* Take regular breaks with sustained use

## How to Deal With a Stimulant Comedown

The main factor in overcoming a stimulant comedown is time, however one can treat them in a number of ways which work in both providing your body the materials it needs to heal as well as helping to abate the symptoms during the healing process.

* Water
* Healthy food
  * Fruits
  * Vegetables
  * Something carb heavy (e.g. pasta)
* Multivitamins
* Shower
* Sleep
* Cannabis 
* OTC sleep aids
  * Melatonin
  * Low dose DPH (25-50mg)
  * Valerian root
  * Most other First Generation Antihistamines
* Exercise
* Distract yourself until you can fall asleep

### Dealing with Amphetamine Psychosis

* Antipsychotics such as Risperidone
* Benzodiazepines such as Lorazepam
* Possible hospitalisation
* Seroquel (2x 50mg, 200mg max)

## After a Stimulant Comedown

Stimulant comedowns are extremely unpleasant experiences, so it would be very wise to try and remember what you're trying to avoid next time you engage in stimulant drugs. If you do choose to use stimulants again, then see mitigating stimulant comedowns to help avoid reaching the same state again.

# Opium Derivatives

## Opium Alkaloids
Thebaine - 6,14 Dimethoxy version of Oxymorphone. Stimulant rather than an analgesic.
Narceine - Bitter, Crystalline, formerly used as a substitute for Morphine.
Noscapine - Acts on the Sigma receptor. Non painkilling. Used commonly in Antitussives. Blocks Bradykinine B-2 receptors in Stroke patients.

## Alkaloid Salt Mixtures
Pantopon - Preparation of all alkaloids present in opium without plant matter. Injectable and slightly less potent than Morphine.

## Morphine Family
6-MDDM - 80x Morphine, has a faster onset and less body load then the prior.
Azidomorphine - 40x Morphine, has a high affinity for μ.
Hydromorphinol - Derivative of Morphine, yet more potent, with a steeper-dose-response curve and a longer half life. Scripted in Sweden.
Methyldesorphin - 15x Morphine. Is found in some mixtures of Krokodil.
MR-2096 - Oxymorphone analogue that is roughly the same potency.
N-Phenethylnormorphine - 8-14x Morphine.
RAM-378 - N-Phenethyl analogue of Hydromorphinol. It is probably more potent as a result.

## 3,6 Morphine Diesters
Diacetyldihydromorphine - Occasionally used as an alternative to diamorphine, of which it is faster acting, longer lasting and has less side effects such as euphoria and addiction. However it is equipotent with Morphine.
Dipropanoylmorphine - Ester of Morphine used to treat severe pain. Rarely used but considered to be safer and less addictive than Morphine. As such carries less side effects, such as euphoria. Slower acting, longer lasting and slightly more potent than Morphine.
Nicomorphone - 2-3x Morphine and commonly prescribed in German speaking countries.

## Codeine-Dionine Family
Heterocodeine - Reverse isomer of codeine. 6x Morphine, while Codeine is a prodrug, Heterocodeine is a direct agonist.
Myrophine - Acts as a prodrug to Morphine. Has a slow onset and longer duration, but reduced potency. Does NOT produce addiction or dependence regardless of dose.
Acetyldihydrocodeine - Used in Germany. Close relative of Thebacon, where only the 6-7 bond is unsaturated. 6-Acetyl derivative of Dihydrocodeine. Metabolizes into Dihydromorphine. Higher lipophilicity than codeine. Would probably be more potent and longer lasting as a result. Higher oral BA than Codeine.

## Morphinones and Morphols

7-Spiroindanyloxymorphone - Odd Oxymorphone analogue that is selective at dopamine.
Acetylmorphone - Acetoxy version of Hydromorphone, has a higher bioavailability as a result.
Chloroxymorphamine - Derivative of Oxymorphone and irreversible full agonist.
Methyldihydromorphone - Related to Heterocodieine not Dihydrocodeine. Is 6-9x Morphine.
Metopon - Methylated Hydromorphone, less potent. More than likely would have more euphoria as a result.
N-Phenethyl - 14-Ethoxymetopon - 60x Morphine, but produces less constipation. d & u agonist.
Oxymorphol - 6-Hydrogenated Oxymorphone.
Pentamorphone - Few times more potent than Fentanyl. Short duration, yet low respiratory depression.

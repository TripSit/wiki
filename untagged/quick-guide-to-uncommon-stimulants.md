2-MDP - Dissociative anaesthetic, NMDA antagonist, simlar effects to PCP in animals, (-) isomer is active. Roughly 1/3rd potency of amphetamine by weight. Lasts over 24 hours.

2C-B-BZP - Benzylpiperazine base with ring-sub pattern of 2c-b. Not a phenethylamine, doesn't produce psychedelic effects. Lasts 3-6 hours. Was sold in Japan in "smartshops"

A-366/833 - Agonist at neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors selective for α4β2 subtype. Been researched as an analgesic. Hasn't passed clinical trials.

A-84/543 ^ That and is used as the "standard" for this family of compounds.

2-Acetoxycocaine - Quicker onset than Cocaine. Four fold increase over cocaine in binding potency for dopamine. And 35 fold enhanced affinity for the norepinephrine. Reduced selectivity for serotonin. Interesting structure.

Adrafinil - Prodrug of Modafinil, unregulated in the US. 1 hour half life.

AL-1095 - Centrally acting, comparable effects to amp. developed by Bristol in the 70's.

Altinicline (SIB-1508Y) agonist at neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors similar to A-366. Releases Dopamine and Acetylcholine in both rodent and primate models. Progressed into Phase 2 clinical trials for Parkinson's.

Amfepramone - Diethylcathinone. By itself lacks any affinity for monoamine transporters and functions as a prodrug to ethcathinone. Very weak dopaminergic and serotonergic. 10-20x stronger on norepinephrine in comparison. Basically can be considered NRA's. Is currently Schedule IV in the United States. Class C drug in the UK. Apparently known as "tombstones" in the UK.

2-amino-1,2-dihydronaphthalene - Also known as 2-AD, rigid analogue of phenylisobutylamine and substitutes amphetamine for it in rat discrimination tests, 1/4th the potency. Closely related to 2-aminotetralin.

2-Aminoindane - 2-AI(RC) Psychoactive compound. Rigid analogue of amphetamine.

5-(2-aminopropyl)indole - 5-IT(RC) indole derivative. Preparation was first reported in 1962 by Albert Hofmann. Positional isomer of AMT. Closer chemically resembles Phethylamines like 5-apb and the likes. Falls under the Analog act in the US with AMT.

6-(2-Aminopropyl)indole - ^. But it has been shown to increase hemoglobin levels in the bloodstream.

Aminorex - Known by many other names. Anorectic stimulant. Is classed within the 2-amino-5-aryl oxazoline class. Closely related to 4-methylaminorex. Shown to have locomotor stimulant effects, lying midway between dextro-amp and Meth. Attributed to the release of cathecholamines. Retired from the market after it was found to result in pulmonary hypertension.

2-Aminotetralin - (2-AT) consiting of a tetralin group combined with an anime. Rigid analogue of phenylisobutylamine. Fully substitutes for D-Amp in rat discrimination tests. Although at 1/8th the potency. Inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Likely induces their release as well. Also likely to act of Dopamine on account of the D-Amp.

Amiphenazole - Traditionally used as an antidote for Barb/opioid overdose. Mixed with bemegride. As well as poisoning from other depressants.

Ampyzine - Pyrazine derivative. That's all I could find with my limited research.

AR-R17779 - Drug that acts as a potent and selective full agonist for the α7 subtype of neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Nootropic effects in animal sudies.

Armodafinal - Basically like all other versions of the ***final's nothing popped very interesting.

Bemegride - Used in barb overdoses. "Popularized" by The suspected Serial Killer Dr. John Bodkin Adams.

Benocyclidine - (BCP/BTCP) RC of the arylcyclohexylamine class. Acts as a Potent and Selective DRI. Pure DRI with negligible affintity for NMDA. Lacks every other propeties in effects, minus stimulant. Found in several MDMA presses.

3-benzhydrylmorpholine - Developed in the 50's by American Home Products Corp. Stimulant and anoretctic effects. Related to pipradrol and phenmetrazine.

Benzofuranylpropylaminopentance - ((-)-BPAP) Catecholaminergic and Serotonergic activity enhancer. Only increases the amount of neurotransmitters that get released. Weak MAO-A inhibitor. Showen to have neuroprotective effects similar to selegiling.

Benzooylthiomethylecgonine - Cocaine Analogue which has a sulfur in place of an oxygen on the single bonded benzoyl ester. Thus lowering potency.

1-Benzyl-4-(2-(diphenylmethoxy)ethyl)piperidine - Acts as a potent and selective DRI.

Benzylpipeazine - BZP, that's about it.

2-benzylpipeazine - 20x less potent than MPH and desoxypipadrol. Synthetic intermediate in other drugs :o. Boring stuff.

4-benzylpipeazine - The exact opposite of ^^. Acts as a MAOI with 20 to 48 fold selectivity for releasing dopamine versus serotonin.

Brasofensine - Phehyltropane. Effective in stimulating LMA and reversing akinesia. Idunknow.

Bromantane - Stimulant with anxiolytic properties developed in Russia during the late 1980's. DSRI. Has an anticholinergic effect at very high doses. Used as a doping agent for athletic performance. No withdrawal symptoms!

BTS 74,398 - Weird structure, centrally acting stimulant drug. Acts as a triple reuptake inhibitor.

Butylolylquinuclidine - Was made to replace cocaine in cocaine addiction, while longest lasting and less potent.

Camfetamine - N-Methyl homologue of fencamfamine. Apparently replaced mephedrone after it's banning?

Meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine

Cilboamine - NDRI, has stimulant and anti-dep effects.

Clofeniciclan - Dopamine-releasing agent developed in the 50's. Proved unpopular as a treatment because of its pronounced stimulant activity

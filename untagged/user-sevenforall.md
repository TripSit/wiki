My interest for psychoactive substances started after watching a (drama) movie about ecstasy, which triggered me to study this mysterious party pill. From there, I found out about psychedelics, and was looking into trying LSA. At the time, however, I considered myself too young, and it wasn't until my late teens until I decided to try LSD. I fell for the prevalent 'scam' in which you get sold 25x-NBOMe instead of LSD. Immediately noticing something was up (it tasted bitter, and I read it was supposed to be tasteless), I tried to find more information, and ended up catching an ongoing addiction to the TripSit drug harm reduction community.

Welcome to the TripSit IRC Channels. We have created a ruleset to help communicating with each other while maintaining a comfortable atmosphere.

Therefore the following rules need to be followed in all TripSit administrated [channels](/en/channels).
These rooms are amongst others:  **#drugs**, **#tripsit**, **#bookclub**, **#compsci**, **#gaming**, **#help**, **#music**, **#news**, **#psychonaut**, **#psychopharm**, **#sanctuary**,   **#tripsitvip**, **#tripsit.me**.

If you have any questions, please join **#tripsit.me** to discuss unclear rules with us.

Should you witness a user breaking one of these rules, use the **~report** command (**~report #channel user reason**) to notify the TripSit [staff](/en/list-of-people).

## Terms of Service
See http://tripsit.me/chat/chat_rules/.

## Non-TripSit Channels
The TripSit Team will not police rooms created by users, however, if there are reports rule violations we reserve the right to intervene, including the permanent shutdown of a channel.

## General Tripsit Rules
Keep discussions in the appropriate channel. The **#drugs** channel is moderated by the TripSit staff and is our most frequently used channel. It is used for general drug discussion. This includes dosage, effects, routes of administration, and just general chat. We have **#psychonaut** for spirituality topics and **#psychopharm** for chemistry topics.

The **#tripsit** channel is for people currently under the influence of drugs and those there to help them.  Please take any drug discussion, arguments or otherwise distracting chatter to **#drugs** instead. Only light-hearted and positive conversation is allowed here: A trip can turn bad just by a simple thought. Anyone caught being facetious will be warned and then banned if need be. Rules are **STRICTLY** enforced in this channel.

Absolutely no gore. Please mark any content 18+ with a NSFW label.

## Attitude
We are a network devoted to harm reduction and positivity, no rude, mean, or judgmental language or discussion. 
This includes racial slurs, homophobia, and all other prejudice against any person or group of people.
Do not insult other users; take heated discussions to private chat.
Posting personal information about channel members is grounds for a permanent network ban. Trying to collect personal info of users is dealt with in the same manner.

## Nicknames
[Nicknames](/en/nicknames) may not contain any racial slurs or bigotry. In this case the user will be forced to choose another name, multiple offenses may result in bans.

## Sourcing

Linking and discussion of vendors for  chemicals and paraphernalia is not allowed, legal, clearnet, or otherwise.

Soliciting of  currencies and drugs results in a warning and/or ban from the network.

**Allowed**

* Linking to a [discussion page for clearnet vendors](/en/clearnet-vendor-discussion)

* Linking to [harm reduction equipment](/en/harm-reduction-supplies)

* Talking about marketplaces in a general sense

* Asking the price of a drug in a general sense

**Be aware** 

We like to deal with other behaviors in a softer manner, by guiding the user and explaining to them what is and isn't allowed. In the case of repeated offences or a bad attitude we reserve the right to forgoe these protocols in favor of the community. Every case is unique and will be dealt with to the best of the ability of the [staff](/en/list-of-people) on duty at the time. Every action is logged and audited.

**Remember: Everything you post on the internet is recorded in some way and can/will make it's way back to you. It is for your own safety and the safety of the network that these rules are in place. We want to provide you with the best network ever. It is ultimately your responsibility what you post in chat. Be aware that legislation differs depending on location and do not suggest illegal acts.**

## Harm Reduction
The TripSit community is devoted to [harm reduction](/en/harm-reduction-supplies), support, and positvitiy, and we will never recommend or tolerate dangerous or reckless drug use.
Users identified as continually engaging in reckless drug-use behavior are seen as a bad influence on the community as a whole, actively working against our [mission statement](http://tripsit.me/about-tripsit/about-tripsit/) to be a a harm-reduction community devoted to positive support. 
It is against the rules to endorse or encourage dangerous behavior regarding drug consumption.
All users are expected to discourage drug dosages, [drug combinations](/en/drug-combinations), or any drug experimentation which could be reliably considered unsafe.  
Note that if a situation is identified as life-threatening, or one in which the community's users believe immediate medical attention is required, we will always attempt to contact local medical personel to help you.
As such, these behaviors are considered against the rules and violators may be subjected to temporary or permanent bans (situation depending).

## Medical Advice
Please avoid spreading misinformation about drug use, which would be harmful to our community. 
No information is always better than wrong information.
In most instances, people on the internet are not qualified to provide medical advice.  
Members of the TripSit community are extremely knowledgeable, wise, and often have ample life experience in a range of situations pertaining to drug use. However, they are no substitute for a personal doctor. 
If you are not 100% positive about the advice you are thinking about giving, don't do it. 
If you don't have sources to validate your claims, do not give medical advice.

## Suicide Threats
While TripSitters will try their best to help member cope with down feelings of depression or worse, we cannot tolerate threats of suicide. 
Suicide, depression and mental illness are not the focus of our network and our staff are not adequately trained to deal with suidical situations, nor is it fair to our network's member's to have the onus of guilt placed upon them for potential outcomes of such situations.
If a member is experiencing suicidal thoughts or tendencies, we kindly ask them to consider professional theraputic assistance.

We endorse Reddit's [SuicideWatch](http://reddit.com/r/suicidewatch) community.

**Suicide prevention hotlines**
* USA, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255  
* [List of international suicide crisis hotlines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_linesInternational)

**Poison control hotlines**
* USA: 888 888 8822
* UK: 111 

In a situation in which we fear for a users life, we will remind them of the guidelines stated above and do everything in our power to assist the member find qualified help. 
In a dangerous overdose situation in which we believe immediate medical attention is required, we will always attempt to contact local medical personel. 
These behaviors disrupt the primary objectives of our community.
Therefore, suicide threats and attempts are considered against the rules, and while we will try our best to help in the immediate timescale, such threats and attempts may result in either a temporary or permanent ban from the community (under discretion from the administrators).

## Mental Illness
While we are very accepting of members who may have mental illnesses and/or disorders, we do not condone or encourage the use or abuse of drugs that could interact, worsen, or otherwise negatively affect your health. 
The TripSit community will not serve as enabler for the destruction of your own mental or physical health.
Please seek medical assistance if you have a question regarding mental illnesses or disorders and their interactions with drugs.
We are not qualified to provide professional medical advice on drug interactions with mental ilnesses.
We are here to help! 
If you want to discuss the topic, feel free to bring it up in our IRC channels or message the TripSit team. 
We are happy to discuss any topic at length with you, warn you of any potential drug interactions as well as give you advice, love, respect and positive energy to the best of our ability. 
The TripSit community is always here to help and support you, no matter what. We love you and want to keep you with us!

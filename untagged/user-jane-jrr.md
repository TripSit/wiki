```
12:14 <jane> so we shall call this jane's law of redosing
12:14 <jane> do not redose when one is playing with herculean doses of anything.
12:14 <ben> I like that idea.
12:14 <ben> haha
12:14 <jane> even little. even bumps. and so on.
12:14 <jane> jus tno.
12:15 <jane> easier to wait for next time. what are you in such a hurry over?

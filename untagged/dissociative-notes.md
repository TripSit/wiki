## METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR (MGluR) LIGANDS

### MGluR I LIGANDS -> MGluR 1 & 5

Agonists:  
Ro67-4853 - Lead compound used to investigate selective positive AM for MGluR1. Studies show that PAMs activate cAMP production, calcium mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation.  
CDPPB - Selective positive AM for MGluR5. It has antipsychotic and nootropic effects and is capable of directly potentiating the depolarization of hippocampal CA1 neurons induced through NMDA administration. It also extinguishes drug-oriented memories hindering treatment and causing relapse.  
Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHGP) - Group selective (possibly) partial agonist for MGluR I. Displays cognitive enhancing effects useful in the treatment of Alzheimers and neuronal injury. Another group agonist, ACPD, can induce convulsions in neonatal rats.

Antagonists:  
CPCCOEt - High selectivity but moderate affinity antagonist at MGluR1 used in research of the behavioural effects of addiction and memory. Impairs fear extinction 48hrs after conditioning but not at 2hrs implying MGluR1 is critical in long term memory.  
CTEP - High potency and selectivity as an MGluR5 antagonist with high BA and long duration (18hrs). Has anti-hyperalgesic (increased sensitivity to pain) effects and has been shown to be neuroprotective and hepatoprotective (prevents damage to liver).  
SIB-1893 - Selective MGluR5 antagonist and positive AM of MGluR4. Has anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects, and reduces glutamate release.  
Mavoglurant - Selective MGluR5 antagonist currently in phase 2&3 trials to treat the underlying disorder behind Fragile X Syndrome (inherited autism and retardation among male South Americans).  
MTEP - Potent, selective allosteric antagonist at MGluR5. Produces neuroprotective, antidepressant, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects. Also reduces symptoms of morphine withdrawal and decreases the addictive effects of nicotine, cocaine and methamphetamine.  
Fenobam - Potent, selective negative AM of mGluR5. Has anxiolytic effects comparable to benzos and also displays additional antidepressant, analgesic and anti-addictive effects.

### MGluR II LIGANDS -> MGluR 2 & 3

Agonists:  
Biphenylindanone A (BINA) - Potent & selective MGluR 2 positive AM. It displays anxiolytic and antipsychotic properties and decreases cocaine self administration.  
LY-487,379 - Selective MGluR 2 positive AM similar to BINA.  
DCG-IV - Group-selective agonist at MGluR2&3. Displays potent neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects as well as anti-Parkinsonian effects, but also impairs the formation of memories.  
Eglumegad - Group selective agonist for MGluR II with possible D2 interaction. As effective an anxiolytic as diazepam without sedation or memory impairment. Relieves the withdrawal symptoms from drugs like nicotine and morphine as well as inhibiting the development of tolerance to M. It is neuroprotective and synergistic with the neuroprotection induced by NMDA antagonists. Also reduces the effects of 5-HT2a agonists. Chronic oral admin. also markedly reduced baseline cortisol (steroid hormone released in response to stress) levels and diminished yohimbine induced stress response (fight or flight). However has low BA so the prodrug LY-544,344 is more likely to be used in trial.  
LY-404,039 - Group selective agonist for MGluR II with considerable affinity for the D2 receptor. It has anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects in animal studies.

Antagonists:  
PCCG-4 - Group selective antagonist for MGluR II with slight selectivity for MGluR2.  
CECXG - Potent, group selective antagonist for MGluR II with reasonable selectivity for mGluR3 at 38x higher affinity than mGluR2.  
LY-341,495* - Potent, group selective antagonist for MGluR II . Shows antidepressant effects while potentiating psychedelics and opioids, as well as modulating dopamine receptor function. The 1-fluorocyclopropane analog has a superior pharmacokinetic profile and similar receptor affinities, making a prodrug from this with the heptyl ester increases BA even further.  
MGS-0039 - Potent, group selective antagonist for MGluR II. Produces antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, and boosts release of dopamine and serotonin in specific brain areas possibly through a similar mechanism as ketamine.  
RO4491533 - Potent, group selective negative AM for MGluR II, being equipotent at mGluR2 and mGluR3. Producing antidepressant effects and reversing the effects of group II agonist LY-379,268 but at lower potency than LY-341,495.

### MGluR III LIGANDS -> MGluR 4, 7 & 8

Agonists:  
PHCCC - Positive allosteric modulator for MGluR4 (Receptor involved in tasting 'umami' or savory tastes), negative AM for MGluR1 (see Group I) and direct MGluR6 agonist (?).  
AMN082 - Selective MGluR7 allosteric agonist. This produces and antidepressant type effect and rapid internallisation. At high doses hypo-locamotion increased significantly (shaking, flinching, general stimulated actions). Seems to also be linked to the PICK1 protein.  
DCPG - MGluR8 agonist. Has anti-convulsant and neuroprotective effects and could be used to treat hyperalgesia.  
L-A4P - Non selective group III MGluR agonist. Indicative of anti-parkinson effects by modulating GABAergic neurotransmission. Activation causes inhibition of GABA release in globus pallidus (involved in regulating voluntary movement) and anti-nociceptive effects.

Antagonists:  
MMPIP - MGluR7 antagonist. Seems to be involved in the downstream response to cocaine in the brain.

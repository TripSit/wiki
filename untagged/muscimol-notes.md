| Agarin, 5-(aminomethyl)-3- [2H] -isoxazolone, pyroibotenic acid, 3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-isoxazole<br><br>Substance type: amino acid, isoxazole derivative<br><br>Muscimol was first described in 1964 as a constituent of Amanita pantherina. Muscimol is the decarboxylated product of ibotenic acid and is considered to be more psychoactive than it. Some 15 to 20 mg is regarded as a psychoactive dosage (Muller and Eugster 1965; Ott 1993,446*; Scotti et al. 1969).<br><br>Muscimol is an analog of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) and docks to its receptor (Johnston 1971). Kavapyrones (cf. Piper methysticum) also bind to the same receptor.<br><br>Ibotenic acid as well as muscimol were detected in the urine of people who had eaten fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) about an hour earlier. An experiment with mice conducted by the same team of researchers found that the amount of active constituents in the urine passed by one inebriated animal was not sufficient to inebriate another animal (Ott et al. 1975). | Muscimol can be purchased from chemical suppliers. The substance is legal and is not subject to any specific regulations.<br><br>**Literature**<br><br>See also the entries for [Amanita muscaria](/en/amanita-muscaria) and [ibotenic acid](/en/chemicals/ibotenic-acid).<br><br>Johnston, G.

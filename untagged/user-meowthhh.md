hi! I am meowthhh, i am from the northeast USA and a student. I like to meow a lot and do stuff. here are a few of my favorite quotes:

"If we had no faults of our own, we should not take so much pleasure in noticing those in others."

I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.~Mark Twain

Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.~ Albert Einstein

Only two things are infinite; The Universe and Human Stupidity, and I'm not sure about the Universe

-Albert Einstein

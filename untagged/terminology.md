## MXE
Methoxetamine

## Agonist
A substance that initiates a physiological response when combined with a receptor.

## Antagonist
A substance that interferes with or inhibits the physiological action of another.

## Cannabinoid
Chemicals produced naturally that bind to cannabinoid receptors. They are involved in a variety of mental and physical processes, including pain regulation, food intake, and reward.

## CNS
Central Nervous System

## Cathinone
Cathinone, or Benzoylethanamine is a monoamine alkaloid found in the shrub Catha edulis (khat) and is chemically similar to ephedrine, cathine and other amphetamines. Cathinone differs from amphetamine by possessing a ketone oxygen atom on the β position of the side chain.

## Chiral
The term chiral describes an object, especially a molecule, which has or produces a non-superimposeable mirror image of itself.

## Dopamine
A neurotransmitter associated with movement, attention, learning, and the brain's pleasure and reward system.

## Enantiomer
One of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical). Think of it like the left and right hand, which are identical aside from orientation.

## GABA
Gamma aminobutyric acid an amino acid that is found in the central nervous system; acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

## LD50
The dosage of a substance at which 50% of the exposed subjects does not survive. To estimate the LD50 for humans, tests are conducted on non-human subjects.

## MAO
Monoamine Oxidase, an enzyme that catalyses the metabolism of many drugs (e.g., DMT, dopamine and serotonin).

## MAOI
Monoamine oxidase inhibitor are drugs that inhibit the action of monoamine oxidase in the brain and so allow monoamines to accumulate.

## Nootropic
Nootropics, also referred to as smart drugs, memory enhancers, neuro enhancers, cognitive enhancers, and intelligence enhancers, are drugs, supplements, nutraceuticals, and functional foods that purportedly improve mental functions such as cognition, memory, intelligence, motivation, attention, and concentration. They are generally neuroprotective, and non-toxic.

## Norepinephrine
Norepinephrine, or noradrenaline, is a catecholamine with multiple roles including as a hormone and a neurotransmitter.

## Phenethylamine
Phenethylamine (PEA) is a natural monoamine alkaloid, trace amine, and psychoactive drug with stimulant effects. In the mammalian central nervous system, phenethylamine is believed to function as a neuromodulator or neurotransmitter.

## Releaser
A releasing agent (RA), or simply releaser, is a drug that induces the release of a neurotransmitter from the presynaptic neuron into the synapse, leading to an increase in the extracellular concentrations of the neurotransmitter.

## Serotonin
A monoamine neurotransmitter, biochemically derived from tryptophan, that is primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, platelets, and central nervous system (CNS) of humans and animals. It is a well-known contributor to feelings of well-being.

## ROA
Common abbreviation for Route Of Administration, used to describe the various different methods of ingesting drugs, including oral, insufflation, sublingual/buccal, rectal, vaginal, intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) injection.

## Bioavailability
The fraction of an administered dose that is absorbed into a living system.

## Oral administration
Route of administration in which the subject swallows a substance.

## Sublingual administration
Route of administration in which the subject places a substance under the tongue.

## Buccal administration
Route of administration in which the subject places a substance against their gums or other oral mucosa.

## Isomer
Each of two or more compounds with the same formula but a different arrangement of atoms in the molecule and different properties.

## DRI
Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor

## SRI
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor

## NDRI
Norepinephrine-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor

## SSRI
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor

## SNRI
Serotonin–Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor

## SNDRI
Serotonin–Norepinephrine–Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor

## TRI
Serotonin–Norepinephrine–Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor

## SARI
Serotonin Antagonist and Reuptake Inhibitor

## TCA
Tricyclic Antidepressant

## TeCA
Tetracyclic Antidepressant

## NMDA
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. NMDA antagonists are often dissociatives.

## TAAR
Trace amine-associated receptor

## Bruxism
Grinding or clenching of the teeth

## Ataxia
Loss of motor coordination

## Pyrrolidine
Amphetamines with a pyrrolidine group.

## Pyrrolidinophenone
Pyrovalerones or Pyrrolidinophenones are Cathinones (βk-Amphetamines) with a pyrrolidine group.

## Steroid
Anabolic steroids are drugs that are structurally related to the cyclic steroid ring system and have similar effects to testosterone in the body. They increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles. Anabolic steroids also have androgenic and virilizing properties, including the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics such as the growth of the vocal cords, testicles (primary sexual characteristics) and body hair (secondary sexual characteristics).

## SARM
Selective androgen receptor modulators or SARMs are a novel class of androgen receptor ligands. They are intended to have the same kind of effects as androgenic drugs like anabolic steroids but be much more selective in their action, allowing them to be used for many more clinical indications than the relatively limited legitimate uses that anabolic steroids are currently approved for.

## Arylcyclohexylamine
A class of dissociatives, which includes PCP, Ketamine, Methoxetamine and others. An arylcyclohexylamine is composed of a cyclohexylamine unit with an aryl moiety attachment. The aryl group is positioned geminal to the amine. In the simplest cases, the aryl moiety is typically a phenyl ring, sometimes with additional substitution. The amine is usually not primary, secondary amines such as methylamino or ethylamino, or tertiary cycloalkylamines such as piperidino and pyrrolidino, are the most commonly encountered N-substituents.

## Diarylethylamine
A novel class of drugs, includes Diphenidine, Lefetamine, MT-45 and others.

## Thienodiazepine
Close analogues of benzodiazepines.

## NBOMe
N-Benzyl-Ortho-Methoxy derivatives of psychedelic phenethylamines.

## NBOH
N-Benzyl-HydrOxy derivatives of psychedelic phenethylamines.

## NBF
N-Benzyl-Fluoro derivatives of psychedelic phenethylamines.

## DALT
Diallyltryptamine

## DET
Diethyltryptamine

## DPT
Dipropyltryptamine

## DiPT

## THC
Tetrahydrocannabinol

## CBD
Cannabidiol

## Lethargy
A lack of energy and enthusiasm.

## Blepharospasm

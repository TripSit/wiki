Tryptamines, specifically substituted tryptamines, are organic compounds built upon a core tryptamine backbone. This fundamental structure consists of an indole ring and an amine group connected by an ethyl sidechain. Substituents can be located at the amine, on the indole ring, or along the sidechain.

This broad class of substances includes neurotransmitters like serotonin, alongside numerous alkaloids found in plants and fungi, such as [psilocybin](/en/chemicals/psilocybin-psilocin), [bufotenine](/en/chemicals/bufotenine), [DMT](/en/psychedelics/dmt), and [mescaline](/en/stimulants/mescaline). Ann and Alexander Shulgin extensively researched and documented many novel compounds within this class in their book *TiHKAL*. More complex compounds like [LSD](/en/psychedelics/lsd), [yohimbine](/en/chemicals/yohimbine), and [mitragynine](/en/mitragyna-speciosa) are technically tryptamines. Most psychoactive tryptamines have [psychedelic](/en/psychedelics), empathogenic and to a lesser extend stimulating effects.

## Ring and Amine Substituted Tryptamines

### Amine Substitutions
Substituents at the amine are typically **alkyl groups**, starting with methyl groups. There are usually two substituents at the amine. Interestingly, DMT, with two methyl groups at the amine, is orally inactive. However, [MET](/en/met), which has one methyl and one ethyl group, is orally active, as are other tryptamines with larger alkyl substituents at the amine.

### Indole Ring Substitutions
The most common substituents on the indole ring are **hydroxy and acetoxy groups** at the 4th carbon, and **methoxy groups** as well as **halogen substituents** at the 5th carbon.

It's widely believed that 4-AcO-Tryptamines are at least partially prodrugs to their 4-HO-Tryptamine equivalents.<ref>Jones, Nathan T et al. "*In vivo* validation of psilacetin as a prodrug yielding modestly lower peripheral psilocin exposure than psilocybin." *Frontiers in psychiatry* vol. 14 1303365. 8 Jan. 2024, doi:10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1303365</ref> In contrast, 5-HO-Tryptamines and 6-HO-Tryptamines, like bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), are either inactive or less active than their 4-HO counterparts. This difference in activity may be due to 5-HO-Tryptamines being more hydrophilic than 4-HO-Tryptamines, which makes it harder for them to cross the blood-brain barrier. Similarly, 4-, 6-, and 7-MeO-Tryptamines also appear to be inactive.<ref>Shulgin, Alexander; Ann Shulgin (September 1997). TiHKAL: The Continuation. Berkeley, California: Transform Press. ISBN 0-9630096-9-9. OCLC 38503252</ref>

Regarding halogenation, tryptamines with halogens at the 5th position are active, whereas those halogenated at the 4th and 6th positions do not seem to be.

## α- and β-substituted Tryptamines

### α-alkylated Tryptamines
α-alkylated tryptamines, such as [αMT](/en/stimulants/amt) and [αET](/en/αet), are active substances that tend to be more empathogenic and stimulating compared to their non-α-substituted counterparts. While simpler amine and ring substituted tryptamines typically act as serotonin receptor agonists, α-alkylated tryptamines function as **monoamine oxidase inhibitors** (MAOIs) and **monoamine releasing agents**. This difference in mechanism accounts for their distinct subjective effects.

### β-substituted Tryptamines
Most β substituted tryptamines are **β-ketones**. β-ketone tryptamines are analogues to cathinones (β-ketone-phenethylamines). They are neither serotonin agonists nor MAOIs; instead, they act as **monoamine releasing agents**. Some of these compounds are selective **serotonin-dopamine releasing agents**, being very weak norepinephrine releasers.

## Complex Substituted Tryptamines
More complex compounds like [Iboga alkaloids](/en/psychedelics/ibogaine), [β-carbolines](/en/untagged/harmine-notes), [ergolines](/en/chemicals/ergot-alkaloids) (including LSD), and mitragyna alkaloids technically contain the tryptamine structure as part of their larger molecules. These compounds are incredibly diverse can not be categorised easily. For example, mitragyna alkaloids act on opioid receptors, making them atypical [opioids](/en/opioids).

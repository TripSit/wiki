When bees sip nectar from these beautiful orchids, which are found in Sri Lanka, India, and Burma (Myanmar), they soon fall to the ground in a narcoticized stupor (cf. honey). In India, a psychoactive use of this plant is said to have been derived from observations of this occurrence: 'Ayurvedic shamans used the flower in a decoction to achieve the hypnotic narcosis of their office, permitting them a transcendent state of being" (Emboden 1979, 17*).

No active principles are known (Emboden 1979, "194*).

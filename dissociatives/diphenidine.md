**Diphenidine** (1-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperidine) is a dissociative anesthetic drug.

## History

The first synthesis of diphenidine was published in 1924 by Christiaen who used a modified Brulyants reaction, similar to the reaction later used by Maddox in the first PCP synthesis.

While diphenidine was never used or investigated medically, several related compounds have been and include the withdrawn analgesic lefetamine and investigational compounds such as AstraZenica's NMDA antagonist antidepressant Lanicemine, and neurodegenerative disease and anti-epileptic agent Remacemide.

Shortly after the UK arylcyclohexylamine ban in early 2013, diphenidine and its 2-MeO derivative methoxphenidine emerged on the RC market.

## Dosage

Diphenidine can also be insufflated, vaporized and injected. Start with low doses and work your way up.

## Duration

| Oral |  |
|------|------|
| Onset | 15-30 minutes |
| Total | 2-5 hours |
| After-effects | 4-24 hours |

## Effects

### Postive

* Stimulation
* Euphoria
* Disconnected thoughts
* Shifts in perception of reality

### Neutral

* Altered time perception
* Disrupted speech patterns
* Distorted sensory perceptions, hallucinations
* Confusion

### Negative

* Severe dissociation, depersonalization
* Ataxia (loss of motor coordination)
* Temporary amnesia

## Harm Reduction

See [Dissociative Harm Reduction](/en/dissociatives#harm-reduction) for general information.

### Potentiators

* CNS depressants

### Interactions

It is currently unknown whether diphenidine is a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (SRI), if that is the case do **NOT** ever combine it with other SRIs (such as MXE) or SSRIs.

Check out our [Drug Combinations](/en/drug-combinations) page and chart for interactions and combinations of common drugs.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Diphenidine is a NMDA antagonist and possibly a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin or dopamine.

## Legal status

Diphenidine is, as of July 2014, not a controlled substance in any country.

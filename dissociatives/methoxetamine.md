**Methoxetamine** (MXE, 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE) is a near chemical analogue of [Ketamine](/en/ketamine) and [PCP](/en/pcp). It was first publicly reported in 2010. Some say it's similar to Ketamine or high doses of DXM. Methoxetamine differs from many dissociatives such as ketamine and phencyclidine that were developed as pharmaceuticals in that it was designed specifically for grey market distribution, making it a rare instance of a true designer drug. It has been shown to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist and unlike ketamine also acts as Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SRI). The N-Ethyl group on this compound increases potency.

## Effects

### Positive
* Euphoria, mood lift
* Sense of calm and serenity
* Vivid recall of past memories and dreams
* Closed- and open-eye visuals (common)
* Out-of-body experience (less intense then ketamine)

### Neutral
* Distortion or loss of sensory perceptions (common)
* Dissociation of mind from body
* Sweating
* Analgesia, numbness
* Significant change in perception of time
* Increase in heart rate
* Confusion, disorientation

### Negative
* Risk of psychological dependency
* Nasal discomfort upon insufflation
* Blacking out and forgetting one has taken a drug
* Discomfort, pain or numbness at injection site (with IM)
* Severe confusion, disorganised thinking
* Vertigo, spinning sensation (risk of injury)
* Nausea, vomiting
* Susceptibility to accidents (from uncoordination and change in perception of body and time)
* Severe dissociation, depersonalisation
* Loss of consciousness
* Depression of heart rate and respiration (risk increases with increased dose or when combined with depressants)
* Entity contact

## Harm Reduction

A recent [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30377924) on rats indicates that MXE may have harmful effects on the cardiovascular system, and therefor should probably be avoided by anyone with any history of cardiovascular issues.

See [Dissociative Harm Reduction](/en/dissociatives#harm-reduction) for general information.

### Interactions
MXE is extremely dangerous in combination with alcohol and can cause fatal apnea or respiratory depression.
Even residual MXE can potentiate the effects of 5ht agonists.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Examination of MXE molecule showed that, similar to [Ketamine](/en/ketamine), the 2 isomers have totally different effects with the (S) having potent NMDA activity (when the -OCH3 is deprotected to -OH, it gets stronger) while the (R) isomer has SRI effects and possibly a opioid metabolite.

MXE is generally sold racemic.

## Legal status

Methoxetamine is illegal in the US states Arizona<sup>[1]</sup>, Florida<sup>[2]</sup>, Indiana<sup>[3]</sup>, Louisiana<sup>[4]</sup>, Minnesota<sup>[5]</sup>, North Dakota<sup>[6]</sup>, Ohio<sup>[7]</sup> and Virginia<sup>[8]</sup>. It is also banned in Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, Russia and the UK<sup>[9]</sup>.

| Cats seem to be magically attracted to this plant (and to its varietals), which is frequently grown as an ornamental, and they appear to feel a strong psychoactive effect-hence its name (Siegel 1991a*). The dried leaves can be smoked alone or in smoking blends. The extract can be sprayed onto other smoking herbs. A tea made from equal parts of catnip and damiana (Turnera diffusa) (add 2 tablespoons of each to 1/4 liter of water and allow to steep for five minutes) is said to have mild euphoriant effects (Schuldes 1995,54*).<br><br>Catnip contains an aromatic essential oil composed of nepetalactones, dihydronepetalactone, and isodihydronepetalactone. It also contains the psychoactive alkaloid actinidine. There are many reports of the psychoactive efficacy of smoking catnip leaves, including some from sources that may be taken seriously (Ott 1993, 414f.*; Schultes 1970,42*).<br><br>Amazingly, the active substances in catnip (nepetalactones) are also found in the animal kingdom. They have been demonstrated to be present in the toxin of Myrmacomecocystus, a genus of ant from California. As part of their initiations, some California Indians swallowed these ants alive (wrapped in eagle down) to induce altered states of consciousness. The ants apparently bit into the stomach lining, thereby introducing the active principles into the blood. The ritual use of psychoactive ants was very similar to the use of Datura wrightii (Blackburn 1976*). | **Literature**<br><br>Jackson, B., and A. Reed. 1969.

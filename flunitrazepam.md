**Flunitrazepam** (Also known as Narcozep, Rohypnol, Rohipnol, Roipnol, or Roofies) Is a very fast acting benzodiazepine that is used mostly as a Hypnotic for short-term treatment of Chronic or Severe Insomniacs that aren't responsive for other Hypnotics. Which is why that it is almost always used on a short-term basis. 

## History

It was developed by a team lead by Leo Sternbach at Hoffman La-Roche in 1963. Which showed that an N-Methyl & 2-Fluoro produced the most hypnotic effects. It was used in hospitals when deep sedation was needed. First entered the commerical market in Europe in 1975 as Rohypnol. In the 1980's it began to be available in other countries. In the United States it appeared in the later 1983-84. It came in doses of 1mg and 2mg. But due to its potency and potential for abuse, most European contries changed their drug laws and limited the dose to 1mg. In my countries the maximum dose per package (Prescription) was limited to 20 or 30mg's. In Germany there had been two changes in availability during a short period in the late 1990s. Which restricted the dose to 20mg per package. Soon after it was made to limit the dose to only 1mg. While ampoules containing the 2mg solution were not changed by Roche and have been handled as a controlled narcotic like Morphine. In the where Flunitrazepam is available for prescription as both 1mg and 2mg tablets, such as the Netherlands, generic alternatives are available for the 2mg tablets. In Asia and South America there are the original 2mg tablets from Roche. 

The newly designed 1mg tablets introduced in the 1990's by Roche for the European market are identical in all countries. Which are green (which contain a blue colouring) So that the tablets can only dissolve quickly in hot liquids, while turning the drink a blue colour and leaving a green residue in the beverage, which was introduced to prevent use as a date rape drug, and abuse. 

In the 2000's some European countries started to treat Flunitrazepam as a strong narcotic. 

Since November 2011 the drug is only available with a special narcotic prescription in Germany.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Flunitrazepam is classed as a Nitro-Benzodiazepine. It is the fluorinated N-Methyl derivative of Nitrazepam. Other nitro-benzodiazepines include Nitrazepam (which is the parent compound) Nimetazepam (Methylamino Derivative) and Clonazepam (The Chlorinated Derivative) 

The main pharmacological effect of Flunitrazepam are the enhancement of GABA at at the GABA(A) Receptor. Like with most other benzodiazepines, Flunitrazepam's pharmacological effects include sedation, muscle relaxation, reduction in anxiety, and anti-convulsive effects. 

80% of Flunitrazepam that is taken orally is absorbed. Flunitrazepam has a medium half life of 18-26 hours. Which makes the effect persist throughout the next day. Flunitrazepam is lipophilic and is metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. The enzyme CYP3A4 is the main enzyme in its phase 1 metabolism in humans.

This Japanese species of master plant is also found in China. Known as fang-k'uei, the species is mentioned in the herbal Tao Hung-ching: "feverish persons should not take it, for it stupefies and enables spirits to appear." This passage has been interpreted as indicating a possible psychoactivity (Li 1978,21*).

The roots (radix peucedani, qian hu, zenko) of several closely related species are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat disorders of the lung and spleen (Paulus and Ding 1987, 376). The root of Peucedanum decursivum (Miq.) Maxim. is regarded as a nerve tonic and aphrodisiac (Stark 1984, 95*). The roots of the species known as zenko (Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn) are used in. Japanese kampo medicine to treat fever, shivering, and headaches (Tsumura 1991, 175*).

Alkaloid-like substances do occur in the genus Peucedanum. Coumarins have been detected in Peucedanum japonicum (Schultes and Hofmann 1992, 54*). Additional chemical studies are needed (Ott 1993,417*).

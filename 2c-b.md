**2C-B** is a [psychedelic](/en/psychedelics) drug of the [2C-X family](/en/2c-x).
Effects are often described as being more easily managed than other psychedelics; it is often compared to a mixture of a LSD and MDMA.
2C-B is also known for the strong body component of its effects which are alternately described as pleasurable energy or a 'sense of being in the body,' and by others as an unpleasant 'buzzing' or body-load, which is mostly occurring during onset. Users also report open eye visuals in the form of colour distortions, melting like hallucinations, and other minor visual psychedelic effects.

## History

2C-B was first synthesized in 1974 by Alexander Shulgin, and it first saw use among the psychiatric community as an aid during therapy. It was considered one of the best drugs for this purpose because of its short duration, relative absence of side effects, and comparably mild nature. Shortly after becoming popular in the medical community, it became popular recreationally. 2C-B was first sold commercially as an aphrodisiac under the trade name "Eros", which was manufactured by the German pharmaceutical company Drittewelle. From many years after it was available as tablets in Dutch smart shops under the name "Nexus".

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Systematic name: 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine

Unlike most hallucinogens, 2C-B has been shown to be a low efficacy serotonin 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist or even full antagonist. This suggests that the 5-HT2C receptor is primarily responsible for mediating the effects experienced by users of 2C-B, although functional antagonism of 5-HT2A or activation of the 5-HT2A-coupled phospholipase D pathway may also play a role. The rank order of receptorantagonist potency for this family of drugs is 2C-I > 2C-B > 2C-D > 2C-H.

Research suggests that 2C-B increases dopamine levels in the brains of rats, which may contribute to its psychoactivity.

## Harm Reduction

2C-B is known as one of the safer psychedelics, with several reported cases of users far exceeding commonly used dosing limits without lasting adverse physical effects. It is also observed to have a low addiction potential. It is a stimulating psychedelic, and therefore it's important to remain hydrated. Refer to [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](/en/psychedelics#harm-reduction) for more information.

Do not take heroic doses thinking that 2C-B is one of the "safer psychedelics".

### Interactions

2C-B increases dopamine levels and also has an effect on serotonin. Therefore, 2C-B may react negatively with serotonic drugs like anti-depressants and tramadol.

## Legal Status

Internationally, 2C-B is a Schedule II drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In the Netherlands, 2C-B became a list I substance of the Opium Law despite no health incidents occurring. Following the ban, other phenethylamines were sold in place of 2C-B until the Netherlands became the first country in the world to ban 2C-I, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 alongside 2C-B.

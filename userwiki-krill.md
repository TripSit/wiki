I'm 'bout that thug life. Word up. G. 

In all seriousness, I've been an advocate of the HR philosophy since being involved with and around addicts who so desperately needed help instead of punishment. Why harm those who seek to help themselves? It is no more effort to give them the tools they need to succeed than it is to punish them. 

Drugs have interested me for a long time. HR is chance to apply that interest to a socially relevant cause.

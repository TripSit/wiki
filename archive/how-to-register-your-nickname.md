This will register your **current nickname** with NickServ. This means you must change your nickname, using /nick NAME, to your desired nickname **before** registering.

This will allow you to assert some form of identity on the network and be added to access lists for certain channels, such as #tripsitvip.

Furthermore, NickServ will warn users using your nick without identifying and force them to change nicks if they don't identify.

If for some reason your nickname is in use, you can 'kill' ghosts to get your nickname back.

The password is a case-sensitive password that you make up. Please write down or memorize your password! You will need it later to change settings.

**Syntax: REGISTER <password> <email-address>**

**Example: /msg NickServ REGISTER bar foo@bar.com**
**Example: /ns REGISTER bar foo@bar.com**

| sometimes written as Pithecolobium<br><br>The genus Pithecellobium encompasses some two hundred species. It is closely related to and is easily confused with the genus Mimosa. In the Brazilian Amazon, the name jurema is usually given to Mimosa tenuiflora [sYll. Mimosa hostilis] , which is used to prepare an ayahuasca-like drink. However, several species of the genus Pithecellobium, e.g., P. diversifolium (known as jurema branca, "white jurema"), also appear to be used for that purpose (RÃ¤tsch 1988,83*).<br><br>In Brazil, the use of a vinho do jurema made from Pithecellobium has become established among the followers of various cults of West African origin. Apparently the use is connected with the Camdomble god Ossain, who is regarded as a great magician, protector, and discoverer of healing herbs. Psychoactive and other constituents of the genus are largely unknown. Alkaloids and flavonoids have been detected (Schultes and Raffauf 1990, 251 *).<br><br>The species Pithecellobium laetum Benth., which is known as remo caspi, pashaquillo, or shimbillo, contains alkaloids and is used as an ayahuasca additive. In Mexico, the species Pithecellobium arboreum (1.) Urb. and P. donnellsmithii Britt. et Rose are known as frijolillo (Martinez 1987, 1189f.*). This name is also used for Sophora secundiflora. |  |

| Atropin, atropina, atropinum, atropium, DL-hyoscyamine, d,l-hyoscyaminum, DL-tropyltropate, (Â±)-hyoscyamine, 3u( luH,5uH)-tropanyl-(RS)tropate, tropintropate<br><br>**Substance type: tropane alkaloid**<br><br>Atropine was first isolated from the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) in 1820 by Rudolph Brandes, who named the compound after the genus. Atropine is found in many plants of the Nightshade Family (including the genera Atropa, Brugmansia, Datura, Hyoscyamus, Latua, Mandragora). Atropine is chemically related to cocaine (Willstaedter 1889). It also is closely related to scopolamine and hyoscyamine. Hyoscyamine, which is present in many living plants, quickly racemizes into atropine when the raw drugs are dried or stored.<br><br>A therapeutic dosage is usually considered to be 1 mg. It is possible that 10 fig is lethal for children and babies, but not for adults:<br><br>Relatively high doses (10 mg atropine sulfate and above) have a stimulating effect on the central nervous system, affecting especially the cerebrum, diencephalon, and medulla oblongata. The arousal is followed by an anesthesia-like paralysis that can lead to coma and a fatal respiratory paralysis. (Roth et al. 1994,945*)<br><br>The lethal oral dosage for an adult is approximately 100 mg (Roth et al. 1994, 765*).<br><br>The range of atropine's effects includes psychomotor agitation, excitation, constant repetition of a particular activity pattern, a need to talk, euphoria, crying spells, confused speech, hallucinations, spasms, delirium, flushing of the skin, drying of the mucous membranes, coma, unconsciousness, and heart arrhythmia (Roth et al. 1994, 945*). One particularly characteristic effect is a long-lasting dilation of the pupils (mydriasis). It is because of this effect that atropine has long been used in ophthalmology (Jurgens 1930).<br><br>Atropine is also utilized as a component in certain anesthetics (in combination with morphine). Injections of atropine are often administered prior to surgery so that the mucous membranes will remain dry during the procedure and the patient will not choke on his or her own saliva. Atropine has also been used to treat asthma (Terray 1909).<br><br>When it is given orally, the typical effects of atropine (dry mouth, pupillary dilation, increased pulse rate) manifest about twice as strong as compared to intramuscular injection (Mirakhur 1978).<br><br>Some of the atropine is excreted in the urine unchanged (Roth et al. 1994,945*).<br><br>Atropine is an important antidote in cases of poisoning (overdoses) caused by the fungal toxin muscarine (cf. Inocybe spp.), Digitalis purpurea, hydrogen cyanide, opium (cf. Papaver somniferum), and morphine (Rompp 1995, 298*). Overdoses of atropine can be successfully treated with morphine.<br><br>Because of its unpleasant side effects (dryness of the mouth, difficulties in swallowing, disturbances in vision, confusion), atropine as a pure alkaloid has never acquired any cultural significance as a psychoactive substance. However, the medical literature does contain a few reports of "atropine addiction" (Flincker 1932). | Atropine is available both as a pure substance and as atropine sulfate. Although regulated as a dangerous substance, it can be obtained with a prescription and is not included on any list of "narcotic drugs" (Koerner 1994, 1573*).<br><br>**Literature**<br><br>See also the entries for Atropa belladonna, Latua pubiflora, cocaine, and tropane alkaloids.<br><br>Brandes, Rudolph. 1920. -aber das Atropium, ein neues Alkaloid in den BHittern der Belladonna (Atropa belladonna 1.).

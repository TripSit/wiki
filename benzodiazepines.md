Benzodiazepines are drugs which act upon the GABA(A) receptor, and produce a general set of effects which vary by compound, mostly being sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant. The first benzodiazepine, Chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955, and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann–La Roche, which has also marketed diazepam (Valium) since 1963.

# Effects

## Positive

* Anti-Anxiety
* Sedative 
* Muscle relaxant
 
## Negative

* High addiction potential
* Withdrawals can be fatal
* Risk of blackout
* Inability to drink
* Inability to drive
* Loss of balance
* Memory Loss
* Procrastination
* "Hangover"
* Long-term effects
* High addiction potential

# Harm Reduction

* Avoid driving and operating machinery

* Recommended time (pauses) between using the substance

* Addiction potential - High

* Risk of blackouts

* Risk of death when mixed with alcohol or other drugs. **An extremely high percentage of drug-related deaths are due to mixing benzos with other drugs, especially opiates and alcohol.**

* Mental illness

* Heart issues

* CNS depressant when mixed with other drugs

## Research Chemicals

The main danger of the drugs in this class is the risk of blacking out or overdosing by mixing it with other CNS depressants.

Most of the research chemicals from this class are usually active under 10mg's. The best course of action with these substances is putting X amount of active chemical into X amount of your solvent of choice (Such as Propylene-Glycol or Ethanol) And using an oral syringe to get the dose you want. Granted a fair amount are sold are either in presses or on a blotter.

# Chemistry and Pharmacology

The term benzodiazepine is the chemical name for the heterocyclic ring system, which is a fusion between the benzene and diazepine ring systems. Under Hantzsch–Widman nomenclature, a diazepine is a heterocycle with two nitrogen atoms, five carbon atom and the maximum possible number of cumulative double bonds. The "benzo" prefix indicates the benzene ring fused onto the diazepine ring.
Benzodiazepine drugs are substituted 1,4-benzodiazepines, although the chemical term can refer to many other compounds that do not have useful pharmacological properties. Different benzodiazepine drugs have different side groups attached to this central structure. The different side groups affect the binding of the molecule to the GABAA receptor and so modulate the pharmacological properties. Many of the pharmacologically active "classical" benzodiazepine drugs contain the 5-phenyl-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-2(3H)-one substructure.
Nonbenzodiazepines also bind to the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA(A) receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common pharmacophore, which explains their binding to a common receptor site

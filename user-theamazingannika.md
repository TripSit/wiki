I am a mental health caseworker with a BA in psychology from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I spent my time volunteering for the Tripsit network as as staffed tripsitter.  I enjoy music and learning more about the human mind as well as working with the mentally ill population.  Other hobbies include spending time camping and anything else out doorsy.  My work with Tripsit is built on a respect of the human and spiritual connection to mind altering substances and providing the safest information and assistance to educate others about use and addiction.

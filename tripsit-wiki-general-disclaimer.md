# TripSit Rules

## Network Rules

**The TripSit network includes our IRC servers, Discord servers, website, forum, and any other TripSit-operated platforms.**

### General Rules

1. **Be respectful** - Treat all users with kindness and respect. Personal attacks, harassment, and discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, or any other characteristic will not be tolerated.

2. **No sourcing** - Do not ask for or provide information about where to obtain illegal drugs. This includes vendors, markets, locations, or any other sourcing information.

3. **No sales** - Do not attempt to sell anything in TripSit channels or via private message to TripSit users.

4. **Stay on topic** - Keep discussions relevant to the channel you're in. Use appropriate channels for different topics.

5. **No spam** - Avoid excessive posting, repeating messages, or flooding channels.

6. **Use appropriate language** - While we understand drug discussions may involve adult themes, excessive profanity or graphic content should be avoided.

7. **No ban evasion** - Do not attempt to circumvent bans by creating new accounts or using different connections.

8. **Follow staff instructions** - Comply with requests from moderators and administrators.

### Harm Reduction Focus

TripSit is primarily a harm reduction community. We aim to:

- Provide accurate, evidence-based information about psychoactive substances
- Offer support to those experiencing difficult situations
- Promote safer use practices
- Create a supportive environment for discussion and learning

### Consequences

Violations of these rules may result in:
- Warnings
- Temporary mutes or bans
- Permanent bans for severe or repeated violations

Staff decisions are made with the community's safety and well-being in mind. If you feel a moderation action was unfair, you may appeal through appropriate channels.

### Additional Platform-Specific Rules

Some platforms may have additional rules specific to their format and community guidelines. Be sure to familiarize yourself with any platform-specific rules when joining new TripSit spaces.

Remember: TripSit is here to help keep you safe. When in doubt, ask questions and follow harm reduction principles.

Petraphyton caespitosum (Nutt. ex Torr. et

Gray) Rydb., Spirea caespitosum

The North American Navajo-Kayenta Indians are

said to have used this bushlike plant as a narcotic

(Moerman 1986, 466*). However, it contains only

salicylic acid and should therefore be effective solely

as an analgesic (Ott 1993,420*; Grieve 1982,525*).</td>

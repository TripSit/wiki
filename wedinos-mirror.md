TripSit has created and maintains a mirror of sample results from the [WEDINOS](http://wedinos.org) drug testing facility, scraped from their website and hosted in such a way that individual results may be specifically linked to and referenced permanently. It can be found at [http://wedinos.tripsit.me/](http://wedinos.tripsit.me/). All data is the property of WEDINOS, and is only repeated for ease of use. The code used to acquire the information is open source under the MIT licence and can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/reality/201218e4aa309f8d03ca).

## API

API functionality is planned, but not yet available. In the mean-time a full set of results can be found [here](http://wedinos.tripsit.me/results.json).

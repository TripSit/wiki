Drug-checking services allow for laboratory testing of substances to allow people who use drugs to confirm what substances are present in the drugs they are purchasing and taking. In addition, they often publish results and post alerts when there are potentially concerning drugs circulating in a city or region. For example, many services will post alerts if there are highly dosed ecstasy tablets or drugs containing dangerous adulterants, such as xylazine or fentanyl, found in their service area. Because of this, it is a good idea to follow their updates even if you are not using their services yourself.

The following is a list of both mail-in and walk-in drug-checking services. It lists the country in which they are located but some of them may accept samples internationally. Please check the terms and conditions of each service. Many of them do not accept samples of organic material (e.g. mushrooms, cannabis, etc) or substances such as steroids and vitamins. Of course, also exercise caution when sending drugs through the mail and take necessary precautions.

Note that there are additional services which primarily focus on festivals and nightclubs that are not included here as they do not have a fixed location or schedule.

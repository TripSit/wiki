r3-phenethylamines, PEAs, 2-phenethylamines

r3-phenethylamines are derivatives of phenethylamine (Shulgin 1979). The biogenic 2-phenethylamine (PEA) dilates the blood vessels in the brain and consequently can, under certain circumstances, cause headaches or migraines (cf. Theobroma cacao). The most well-known psychoactive r3phenethylamine is mescaline, a component of numerous cacti.

Many cacti (including Gymnocactus Spp.490 and Opuntia spp.) contain phenethylamines that are structurally very similar to mescaline but whose effects are practically unknown (West et al. 1974). It is quite possible that such substances as candicine (Trichocereus spp.), hordenine (Ariocarpus spp., Opuntia clavata Eng.; cf. Meyer et al. 1980 andÂ· Vanderveen et al. 1974), and macromerine (Coryphantha spp.) produce psychoactive effects when used at the appropriate dosages. This area still offers many opportunities for experimental human pharmacology (Heffter technique). Such experimentation could, for example, lead to a psychoactive use of the South American Notocactus ottonis (Lehm.) Berg. [syn. Parodia ottonis] (cf. Hecht 1995,82), a cactus that is often found at places where cacti are sold, is very easy to grow, and contains hordenine (Shulgin 1995, 16*). The genus Lobivia also contains hordenine (Follas et al. 1977).

Hordenine and related substances (occasionally in high concentrations) are also found in other plants, such as the Himalayan Leguminosae Desmodium tiliaefolium G. Don (Ghosal and Srivastava 1973).

Numerous phenethylamines that have psychoactive effects (both empathogenic and/or psychedelic) have been synthesized (e.g., MDMA, MDA, MMDA, MDE, 2-CB, et cetera; cf. Shulgin and Shulgin 1991*).

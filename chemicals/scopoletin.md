Schmidt from the roots of Scopolia atropoides (= Scopolia carniolica). It is very closely related to atropine and is a characteristic component of plants from the Nightshade Family (Solanaceae), especially the psychoactive species. For the pharmaceutical industry, the most important sources of scopolamine are the Australian duboisias (Duboisia spp.), the dried leaves of which can contain up to 70/0 alkaloids. Scopolamine is also produced by the recrystallization of hyoscyamine.<br><br>For medicinal purposes, scopolamine is administered at dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg, with a total daily maximum dosage of 3 mg. The lowest lethal dosage for humans is about 14 mg (Roth et a1. 1994:921*).<br><br>Scopolamine is a very potent hallucinogen that Leuner (1981 *) classified as a "Class II" hallucinogen because of its simultaneously hallucinogenic and narcotic/consciousness-clouding effects (cf. also Dittrich 1996*).<br><br>According to Hunnius, scopolamine is utilized in medicine as a hypnotic agent, especially for cases of "agitated states in the mentally ill, for Parkinson's and paralysis agitans, and for treating withdrawal of morphine users" (Hunnius 1975, 609*).<br><br>In contrast to atropine, which initially stimulates the central nervous system, scopolamine induces predominantly a narcotic paralysis from the beginning, which is why it serves as a "chemical straitjacket" for agitated mental patients. Delirium and hallucinations are not infrequently seen ... with therapeutic application. . . . Chronic scopolamine poisoning with gradually increasing dosages leads to psychoses with hallucinations. (Fiihner 1943, 202 f.*)<br><br>In the former East Germany, scopolamine was still being used as a "chemical straightjacket" in the 1980s (Ludwig 1982, 148*; Schwarz 1984). Scopolamine may be combined with morphine for the same purpose (Rompp 1950, 264*). A combination of scopolamine hydrobromide and morphine hydrochloride is used as a preoperative anesthesia (cf. soporific sponge). Recent tests with mice found that scopolamine hydrobromide causes a marked increase in anxiety as compared to scopolamine methylbromide (Rodgers and Cole 1995).<br><br>To treat motion sickness-a use to which scopolamine has long been put (Rompp 1950, 265*)-an adhesive patch was developed that contains 1.5 mg scopolamine and can be adhered behind the ear as needed. The active component is absorbed through the skin into the blood vessels of the ear region and affects the organs of balance in the ear. This property of scopolamine supports the idea that the constituents found in witches' ointments could be absorbed when the mixtures were rubbed onto the skin.<br><br>Scopolamine was a popular inebriant in the Munich jazz scene of the 1950s. Because the dosages used were often so high, many of the concerts had to end early. | (from Festi1995*;Hagemann et a1. 1992; Ripperger 1995; supplemented)<br><br>**LORANTHACEAE**<br>*Benthamia alyxifolia* - leaves<br><br>**SOLANACEAE**<br>*Anthoceris ilicifolia* Hook. - root<br>*Atropa belladonna* (L-scopolamine) - root<br>*Atropanthe sinensis* (Hems1.)

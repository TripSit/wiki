The root of this plant is said to have been used by the Navajo-Kayenta Indians as a narcotic (Moerman 1986,469*). It is questionable whether this information is correct, for the root is also used as a kind of chewing gum (Vestal 1952, 53*). The chemistry of the plant is unknown (Ott 1993, 420*). It is, however, regarded as a "life medicine." Perhaps it is a psychoactive chewing gum.

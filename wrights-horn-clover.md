The Navajo Indians regard this plant as a "life medicine" and use it ritually in hunting (Vestal 1958, 32*). The Apache used the roots as an inebriating additive for their homemade beer (see [beer](/en/beer)). It is possible that the root cortex contains alkaloids, e.g., tryptamines, which are also found in many other plants of the same family.

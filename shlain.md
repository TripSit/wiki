| In Cambodia, shlain is a name for both a tree and its product. The very hard wood of the shlain tree is light colored, almost white. It is shaved, mixed with hemp (Cannabis indica, Cannabis sativa), and smoked. The addition of shlain to the hemp clearly increases the effects of the THC and makes it somewhat more psychedelic. The wood has been tested many times with success, but unfortunately its botanical identification is still uncertain. It is, however, possible that it is Strychnos nux-vomica.<br><br>In Cambodia, a traditional cough medicine is made from dried kancha (hemp herbage), which is chopped up on a board made from nux-vomica (Strychnos nux-vomica) wood. Mixed with small pieces of the wood (which contains strychnine), the resulting product is then smoked (Martin 1975,67). | **Literature**<br><br>Martin, Marie Alexandrine. 1975.

| This ancient cultigen and spice plant, which is common in Europe and North America, is purported to have psychoactive or hallucinogenic effects (Farnsworth 1972, 68*; Schultes and Hofmann 1980,367*). Borage contains the slightly toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids lycopsamine and intermedin, as well as their acetyl derivatives, amabiline and thesinine (Roth et al. 1994, 169*). In phytotherapy, borage is indicated for several conditions that are at least partially related to consciousness (Haas 1961): *An invigorating tea of leaves and flowers is ideal for stress, depression, or following a treatment with cortisone. Borage mitigates fever, dry coughs, and skin rash. The oil of the seeds is helpful for menstrual problems, nervous intestinal complaints, high blood pressure, and hangovers* (Bremness 1995, 233*). Borage pills are sold to dehydrate and "purify the blood." Flowers harvested during the time of blossom are ingested as a folk medicinal sedative (Ratka 1992). | **Literature**<br><br>Haas, H. 1961.

## Other Names

Nicotin, nikotin, (-) -nikotin , 1-methyl-2(3-pyridyl)pyrrolidine, 3-( 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)pyridine

**Substance type:** pyrrolidine alkaloid, pyridine alkaloid, tobacco alkaloid

Nicotine was first discovered in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and was named for the genus. It occurs in numerous species of Nicotiana as well as other members of the Nightshade Family. It has also been found in club moss (Lycopodium clavatum).

Nicotine is very easily absorbed through the mucous membranes and even through the skin. Consequently, plants that contain nicotine can be smoked or administered as enemas. Nicotine is broken down through oxidation, and about 10% is excreted unchanged. It has stimulating effects upon the central nervous system and has paralyzing effects at very high dosages (cf. cytisine). In the peripheral nervous system, nicotine behaves in a similar manner as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

High dosages can result in sudden death due to respiratory paralysis or cardiac arrest within five minutes of ingestion (Roth et al. 1994, 864*). From 40 to 60 mg represents a lethal dosage for humans (Frerichs, Arends, Zarnig, Hagers Handbuch). Diazepam can be effective as an antidote for nicotine poisoning (Roth et al. 1994, 865*). Nicotine is now generally regarded as highly "addictive" (Schiffman 1981). Although it is commonly assumed that nicotine causes cancer, uncertainty has been expressed about this theory (Schievelbein 1972).

Nicotine has been detected in Egyptian mummies (New Kingdom) (Balabanova et al. 1992*). However, this discovery should not be taken as evidence that the Egyptians knew of wild tobacco (Nicotiana rustica), as the Balabanova team in Munich has suggested, for some Old World plants also contain nicotine (see the table at right).

## Commercial Forms and Regulations

Nicotine can be obtained in its pure form from chemical suppliers. It is subject to the laws covering the transport of dangerous substances and is classified as a Category 1 substance on the Swiss Poison List. In the United States, pure nicotine is available only with a prescription (Ott 1993, 447*). In Germany, it is subject to the laws regarding dangerous substances but is not regarded as a "narcotic."

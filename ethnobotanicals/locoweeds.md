Several species from the genus Oxytropis are known in North America by the Spanish-English name locoweed, "crazy weed" (cf. Astragalus spp.), and have toxic or psychotropic properties (Turner and Szczawinski 1992, 122*). The Indians used some species for medicinal purposes (Johnston 1970,314*). Several species were used as a ritual or medicinal wash during sweathouse ceremonies (Moerman 1986, 320 f.*). In Mexico, the species Oxytropis lamberti Pursh. is called hierba loca, "crazy herb" (Martinez 1987,427*; Reko 1938, 185*).

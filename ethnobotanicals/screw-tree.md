In Papua New Guinea, the fruit of an as yet unidentified Pandanus species is said to be used or to have been used as a hallucinogen. Unfortunately, we have no dependable ethnographic or ethnobotanical information about this. The fruits of several Pandanus species have been found to contain N,N-DMT (Schultes and Hofmann 1992, 52*). The species Pandanus antaresensis St. John is used in Papua New Guinea as an analgesic (Ott 1993, 401*). The Australian Aborigines make a wine from the fruits of Pandanus spiralis R. Br. (Bock 1994, 147*).

In Nepal, the screw pine (Pandanus nepalensis St. John [syn. Pandanus furcatus auct. non. Roxb.]) is considered sacred to Ganesha, the Hindu elephant-headed god. The leaves of the kevada or aromatic screw pine Pandanus odoratissimus L. [syn. P. tectorius auct. non. Soland. ex Parkinson], which is called ketaka in Sanskrit, are offered to his father Shiva (Majupuria and Joshi 1988, 170f.*). In Ayurvedic medicine, the leaves are used as a tonic aphrodisiac, while in Thailand they are often used as a cooking spice (Norman 1991,66*). In Hawaii, root tips that grow above the ground are used together with sugarcane juice to make a tonic (Krauss 1981, 6*). The flowers contain a stimulating essential oil composed of benzyl benzoate, benzyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, geranol, linalool, guiacol, phenethyl alcohol, and aldehydes (Majupuria and Joshi 1988, 171*). In India, the ripe spadix of Pandanus tectorius Parkins. ex Du Roi [syn. Pandanus odoratissimus 1. f.] is the source of the so-called kewda perfume, one of whose uses is to aromatize smoking tobacco (Nicotiana rustica, Nicotiana tabacum) (Bartels 1993, 122*).

In the Seychelles, a number of species known as vacoa are regarded as aphrodisiacs (MiillerEbeling and Ratsch 1989, 72*).

In Ladakh, this insectivorous plant is known as lingna. There, the dried and powdered leaves are roasted on a flat stone, after which the powder is mixed with water and put in a bottle, which is then buried for ten to fifteen days. The Ladakhis enjoy this drink (lingeatzish) primarily in winter. It is said to have very inebriating effects and can cause death if consumed in excess (Navchoo and Buth 1990,320*).

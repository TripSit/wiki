Various species of this genus are used in South America as ayahuasca additiveas. Some species, under the name cimora or timora, are added to San Pedro drinks (see Trichocereus pachanoi). Iresine species also are said to be the main ingredient or at least one of the main ingredients in the mysterious South American magical drink cimora (Ott 1993, 409*). Unfortunately, chemical studies are lacking. Betacyanin has been detected in the herbage of the Caribbean Iresine herbstii Hook. f. (Wong 1976, 119*).

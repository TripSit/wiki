This euphorbia has a questionable reputation as a hallucinogen (Schultes and Farnsworth 1982, 187*; Schultes and Hofmann 1980,367*). This assumption apparently dates back to a report by Victor A. Reko in his book Magische Gifte [Magical Poisons] (1938, 176-81*), which claimed that North American Yaqui Indians use the crushed seeds of the plant as a tonic during strenuous exertion.

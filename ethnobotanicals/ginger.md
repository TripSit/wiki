| Ginger comes from the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia, but it has been planted throughout tropical Asia for at least three thousand years (Norman 1991,62*) and is now planted in tropical areas around the world. It has acquired an ethnopharmacological significance among many American Indian peoples. It is frequently used both as a spice and as a medicine, e.g., for upset stomachs (Ratsch 1994b, 58*). In Ecuador, where ginger is known as ajej, the Shuar, Achuar, and Aguaruna all use it as a hallucinogen. The shamans ingest ginger to obtain magical power (Bennett 1992,493*). The Carina rub a mixture of gingerroot and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) onto the eyelids of apprentice shamans so that they may be able to see the spirits of the forest. Ginger is also one of the initiatory plants of the novice shamans on the Indonesian island of Siberut:<br><br>Finally, every novice is given ('seeing" eyes. He goes with the teacher to a secluded spot in the vicinity and must make a promise never to betray the secret.... Old shamans explain that the novice is called upon to massage a small disease stone out of a spear that he has brought with him and which the ancestors have placed inside as a test. After he has attempted this for a while without success, the master shows him how it is done. Afterward, burning ginger juice is dripped from a little bottle into the novice's eyes and he becomes able "to see." The master then asks him what he sees. (Schefold 1992, 116)<br><br>Ginger extracts have clear effects upon the central nervous system, but whether they are able to induce hallucinations (in what dosages?) is questionable (Bennett 1992, 490*). The use of ginger as an aphrodisiac is widespread. The Secoya number ginger among the nuni, the plants of supernatural origin (Vickers and Plowman 1984, 33*).<br><br>In .Papua New Guinea, the roots of bitter ginger, a wild ginger species (Zingiber zerumbet [1.] Sm.), are known as kaine. They purportedly were used together with a Homalomena species (Homalomena sp.) as a hallucinogen (cf. also Kaempferia galanga). In the South Pacific, a ginger species is used for magical purposes. On the Gazelle Peninsula (formerly New Pomerania), ginger leaves and roots are used in all magical acts. For these reasons, ethnologists have characterized ginger as the "mandrake root of the indigenous people" (cf. Mandragora officinarum) (Meier 1913). | **Literature**<br><br>Meier, P. Joseph. 1913.

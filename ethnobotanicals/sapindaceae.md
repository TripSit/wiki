This Southeast Asian tree may be identical to a plant that ancient Chinese sources refer to as lungIi, which was said to have hallucinogenic effects (Li 1978, 24 f.*). Nephelium, however, contains only toxic cyanogenic glycosides (Schultes and Hofmann 1995, 51*; Schultes and Farnsworth 1982, 187*). This botanical identity is questionable (Li 1978, 24*).

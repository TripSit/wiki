This bushy mint is native to the central Asian steppes of Turkistan and Uzbekistan. It is gathered in autumn and hung on the rafters to dry over the winter. The leaves are used to make a tea that is sweetened with honey and induces a mild state of euphoria, although it also can be used as a sedative (D. McKenna 1995, 103*). In Russian folk medicine and phytotherapy, the plant is also used to treat allergies and skin diseases and to promote blood coagulation (Schultes and Hofmann 1992, 47*).

The dried material (leaves) contains up to 17% lagochiline, a diterpene alkaloid (the average is around 30/0; Schultes 1970,41*; Tyler 1966, 287*). Numerous studies are available in the Russian literature. The plant is, or at least was, listed as a natural tranquilizer in the Russian pharmacopoeia (D. McKenna 1995, 103*; Scholz and Eigner 1983, 78*).

This plant was originally native to Eurosiberia but is now common in Switzerland and has spread even to North America (Lauber and Wagner 196, 1204*). In Denmark, the yellow-blossomed herbage, known as haret hfJgeurt, is smoked in joints. One gram is said to produce good psychoactive or euphoriant effects (Larris 1980). The plant is known as hawkweed in the United States and was used by the Iroquois for ethnomedicinal purposes (Ott 1993, 409*). The leaf rosette (without the roots) of the blooming plant, which is common to meadows and moorlands, is collected and dried in the shade. It is sold in pharmacies and herb shops under the names herba auriculae muris and hieracii pilosellae herba. It contains tannins, flavonoids, and umbelliferone. It is used in folk medicine to treat and strengthen the eyes (as a tea or eyewash). The German name for the plant, habichtskraut ("goshawk's weed"), is derived from the belief that goshawks receive their excellent vision from this plant (Pahlow 1993, 146*). This belief may be rooted in Old Germanic shamanism. In Germany, the plant formerly was reputed to offer magical protection against witches and magic (Perger 1864, 133*). Also known as little mouse ears or nail weed, the plant is said to be harmful to sheep (Chamisso 1987,228*).

Today, hawkweed is usually sold in German pharmacies under the name pilosellae herba. When I smoked about 1 g, I felt slightly euphoric and cannabis-like, but relatively weak, effects.

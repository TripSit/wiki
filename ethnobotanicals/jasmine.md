The flowers of several jasmine species are the source of the aromatic jasmine oil (oleum jasmini), which contains eugenol and plays an important role in the perfume industry (cf. essential oils). Moreover, two African species have been reported to have psychoactive effects. In Abyssinia, the leaves of Jasminum floribundum R. Br. (known as hab el tsalim) are used as an "inebriating agent"; the leaves of Jasminum abyssinicum R. Br. are used in Eritrea for the same purpose (Hartwich 1911, 811 *). The constituents are unknown. Gelsemium sempervirens is also known as yellow jasmine.

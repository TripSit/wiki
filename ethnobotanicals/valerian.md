| Valerian is an Old Germanic ritual and healing plant. It was sacred to the goddess Hertha, who rode upon the red deer. Wieland, the shamanic smith of the Germanic mythological world, used the root to heal diseases. For this reason, valerian was also known as velandswurt, "Wieland's root" (Weustenfeld 1995, 13*). In earlier times, valerian was hung on houses as a protection against witches and witchcraft, evil spirits, and devils. The root was also used as a fumigant to keep away the devil (cf. incense). In the early modern period, valerian root was regarded as an aphrodisiac and was used to treat the "sacred disease" (epilepsy) (Knoller 1996, 12 f.). It was also known as theriac root, for it was an important ingredient in the panacea theriac (Weustenfeld 1995, 15*).<br><br>Valerian (along with the variety Valeriana officinalis 1. var. sambucifolia Mikan.) is also called cat weed and is renowned for the power it has to attract cats (cf. Nepeta cataria). The sedative effects that the root has upon the nervous system are quite well known (Pahlow 1993,64*). Valerian roots are sometimes characterized as a "legal high" with psychoactive powers (Schultes and Hofmann 1980, 368*). In particular, a tea made of equal parts of valerian root and kava-kava (Piper methysticum) is said to produce "beautiful dreams" (Schuldes 1995, 76*). When mixed with hops (Humulus lupulus), valerian yields a potent tea for inducing sleep (cf. also diazepam).<br><br>In South America, Valeriana longifolia H.B.K. is regarded as a panacea and stimulant for elderly people suffering from infirmity. There, various Valeriana species are referred to as contrayerba (cf. Trichocline spp.). Valeriana adscendens Turz. is known as hornamo morado in Peru, where it is used as an additive to San Pedro drinks (cf. Trichocereus pachanoi). The North American Blackfeet Indians smoke the roots of Valeriana sitchensis Bong, known as tobacco root, either alone or mixed with tobacco (see kinnikinnick) (Johnston 1970, 320*). In India and Nepal, the aromatic root of Valeriana jatamansi (DC.) Jones [syn. Valeriana wallichii DC.], known as samya or muskbala, is used as a fumigant or as an ingredient in incense for magical and religious rites (Shah 1982, 298*; Shah and Joshi 1971, 421*). The aromatic root of jatamansi or masi, the closely related species Nardostachys jatamansi (D. Don) DC., is even more highly regarded; it is used both as an incense and to treat epilepsy (Shah 1982, 297*). Whether these two incenses have psychoactive properties, as is sometimes asserted, remains an open question. The sesquiterpene ketone valeranon, which is present in Valeriana officinalis, Valeriana jatamansi, and Nardostachys jatamansi, is presumably responsible for the sedative (tranquilizing) effects (Horster et al. 1977).<br><br>The alkaloid actinidine has been found in the genus (Schultes 1981,42*). Of interest for further research into a possible psychoactivity beyond the sedative effects is the finding that an aqueous extract influences the central nervous system neurotransmitter GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid; see Amanita muscaria, ibotenic acid, muscimole) (Santos et al. 1994). | **Literature**<br><br>Granicher, E, P.

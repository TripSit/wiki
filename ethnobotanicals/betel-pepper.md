**Forms and Subspecies**

The two most frequently cultivated and utilized varieties differ from one another primarily in their concentrations of essential oil and oleoresins:

Piper betle L. var. bangla: 5.90/0 oleoresin, 1.6% essential oil

Beatelvine, betel, betel, betele, betel-leaf, betel pepper, betelpfeffer, betel vine, betle, betre (Malay, "single leaf"), bettele, bettele-pfeffer, bu, buio, bulath (Singalese), bulath-vel, buru, daun syry (Malay), fu-liu, fu-liu-t'eng (ancient Chinese), ikmo (Philippines), liu, ma-lu, nagavalli (Sanskrit), paan, pan, pelu (Thai), pu, sirih, tambul (Sanskrit), tambula (Sanskrit), tembul, veth-thile

**History**

In Southeast Asia and India, the use of betel leaves must be very ancient (cf. [Areca catechu](/en/areca-catechu), [betel quids](/en/betel-quids)). The plant is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts.

The first European representation of the betel leaf (although entirely inaccurate) can be found on a copperplate engraving from the Delle navigationi e viaggi of Giovanni Battista Ramusio (1485-1557), published in Venice in 1553. The first botanically correct representation was published in Paris in 1758 in Histoire generale des voyages, by Antoine-François Prevost.

Today, betel pepper (fresh betel leaves) is one of the most important articles of trade in Southeast Asia and in all areas in which large numbers of Indians or Tamils have settled.

**Distribution**

Betel pepper is indigenous to the Indo-Malayan region but is now grown in all of southern and Southeast Asia and even in the Seychelles and in Mauritius, Madagascar, and eastern Africa. It appears to have originated in central or eastern Malaysia. Some authors have suggested that the plant is originally from Java (Gupta 1991, 79*).

**Cultivation**

Propagation is performed almost exclusively with cuttings taken from the stem (10 to 20 cm in length). They are either placed in water until they develop roots or placed in moist cultivation beds. The plant requires moist and humus-rich soil and a semishaded location (Macmillan 1991,427*).

In the tropics, the leaves of this evergreen plant can be harvested throughout the year. They normally are picked in the early morning.

**Appearance**

Betel pepper is a climbing half-shrub that bears shiny, light green, heart-shaped leaves (up to 18 cm in length). The sheen of the leaves is a reliable characteristic for distinguishing this species from other species of Piper, with which it can easily be confused (cf. [Piper spp.](/en/piper-spp)). The "buds" (spikes) hang on the leafstalks like long, light-colored threads. The male spikes are cylindrical; the female grow to a length of only 4 cm. The fruit IS a spherical drupe about 6 mm in diameter.

**Psychoactive Material**

- Betel leaves (folia piperis betle, piperis betle folium, betel pepper leaves)

Only fresh leaves are suitable for making betel quids; dried leaves can be used for medicinal purposes. The leaves are pressed after they are collected. Occasionally the "buds" (= spikes) are also used for betel quids.

**Preparation and Dosage**

Fresh, undamaged leaves that have not begun to dry are used almost exclusively for psychoactive preparations. A normal dosage is one leaf per betel quid. A tea can be brewed from fresh or dried leaves. Again, one leaf is used per dosage.

**Ritual Use**

In India, all of life is ritually associated with the betel pepper. When a parcel of land is being prepared for cultivating betel pepper, a goat is first sacrificed while special mantras are recited. The head of the goat is buried in one corner of the future betel field (paan mara), the four hoofs are buried in the four cardinal directions, and the blood, mixed with earth, is distributed along the borders of the field as a landmark. Then a number of shobhanjana (Moringa oleifera) trees are planted. The betel vines will later grow up the branches of these fast-growing trees. Rows of mandara trees (Erythrina indica; see [Erythrina spp.](/en/erythrina-spp)) are planted along the margins of the field as windbreaks. Anyone who enters the field must perform a gesture of veneration, for the field is regarded as a temple and is revered accordingly (Gupta 1991, 77 f. *).

Betel leaves are regarded as sacred and are among the more important offerings that can be made to Shiva, to whom all inebriating plants are sacred (cf. [Aconitum ferox](/en/aconitum-ferox), [Cannabis indica](/en/cannabis-indica), [Datura metel](/en/datura-metel), [Strychnos nux-vomica](/en/strychnos-nux-vomica)). Myths describe how the betel vine first grew only in heaven. Shiva asked the plant to go to the people on the earth. At first the vine refused because it was afraid that it would not be sufficiently respected and venerated. Shiva promised the plant that its leaves would be used with respect in all ceremonies. When he had convinced the plant, it came down from heaven to the earth. For this reason, it is considered good manners to offer guests a few betel leaves (with or without areca nuts; cf. [Areca catechu](/en/areca-catechu)). Betel leaves are also used for sprinkling sacred water during every ceremony. When the leaves are combined with cloves, castoreum, salt, and red, black, white, and yellow colors, they are considered a sure agent for banishing demons (Gupta 1991, 78 f.*).

**Artifacts**

The heart-shaped leaves have been depicted in Indian art since ancient times and are often used as an ornamental decoration on objects for making or consuming betel quids.

**Medicinal Use**

In the folk medicine of southern and Southeast Asia, betel leaves are chewed or eaten to treat coughing, inflammations of the mucous membranes, diphtheria, inflammations of the middle ear, and all types of stomach ailments. In India, the leaves are also used to treat snakebites and as an aphrodisiac (Gupta 1991,79*).

In Southeast Asia, the roots and inflorescences are used in cases of weak digestion (Macmillan 1991, 424*); the same custom is found in the Seychelles and in other places with an Indian population. In the Seychelles, the leaves are "chewed in order to stay healthy. Seven leaves, finely chopped and placed on wounds, promote healing. A compress is also said to be effective against varicose veins" (Müller-Ebeling and Rätsch 1989,29*).

**Constituents**

The leaves contain 0.2 to 2.60/0 essential oil with phenolic constituents (eugenol, isoeugenol, allylpyrocatechol, chavicol, carvacrol) as well as nonphenolic substances (cineole, cadinene, and acaryophyllene) (Roth et al. 1994, 569*). Also present are safrole, anethol, hentricontane, pentatriacontane, β- and γ-sitosterol, stearic acid, and triacontol. The pungent substance piperine, present in most Piper species, has not been detected in the betel pepper.

A team of Chinese researchers isolated and clarified neolignans (methylpiperbetol, piperol A, piperol B, crotepoxide) from the stems (and leaves) (Yin et al. 1991). Betel pepper flowers contain large amounts of essential oil, primarily with eugenol and isoeugenol.

**Effects**

The leaves have stimulant, antibiotic, digestion-promoting, and antiflatulence effects (Roth et al. 1994, 569*). They have a clear stimulating and awakening effect and open the perception. The effects appear to be synergistically potentiated by the other ingredients in betel quids.

The essential oil has anthelmintic properties (Ali and Mehta 1970) and appears to have antimutagenic and cancer-inhibiting effects. As a result, the betel leaf is an important health-promoting component of the betel quid. Pharmacological investigations of aqueous leaf extracts of Indonesian plants carried out at the Center for Research for Traditional Medicine (Airlangga University, Surabaya) have demonstrated that they stimulate phagocytosis, thereby strengthening the body's immune system (Sutarjadi et al. 1991). On the other hand, the neolignan crotepoxide is said to have pronounced cytotoxic effects (Yin et al. 1991).

**Commercial Forms and Regulations**

Because betel leaves are internationally recognized as not being an "addictive drug" or "narcotic,' the plant is not subject to any laws regarding medicines or similar regulations but is classified as a foodstuff (the laws regulating such products may apply). In Switzerland, the fresh leaves are available in shops selling Indian articles.

| Tetrapteris styloptera Jusseiu<br><br>This little-known, yellow-flowered climbing bush was first described in 1954 by Richard E. Schultes.<br><br>The Maku, who live on the Rio Tikie (Amazonia), call it caapi (cf. Banisteriopsis caapi) and use it for ritual purposes (Schultes 1954, 204). They manufacture from the bark a psychoactive drink that apparently has effects like those of ayahuasca and is used in a similar manner. The bark may contain β-carbolines (Schultes and Hofmann 1992, 58*).<br><br>The Tanimukas call the closely related yellow-flowered Tetrapteris styloptera Jussieu—most likely a synonym—wee-po-awk. They use the powdered bark medicinally as a hemostatic (Schultes 1983, 137).<br><br>Tetrapteris mucronata Cav., known as caapi-pinima, also appears to be used for psychoactive purposes (Schultes and Hofmann 1992, 66f.*). | Schultes, Richard Evans. 1954.

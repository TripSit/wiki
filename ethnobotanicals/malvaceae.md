This prostrate or sometimes bushy plant with yellow flowers is found in the tropical zones of Central and South America. The Cuna Indians (Darien, Panama) esteem the plant, which they call kwala, as a "mystical medicine" (Duke 1975, 292*). A tea made from the leaves is consumed in Bangladesh to help induce sleep (Ott 1993,419*).

Among the Maya, this species is known as chichibeh ("the little one on the path"). On the Mexican Gulf Coast, its leaves, like those of the closely related Sida rhombifolia 1., are smoked as a marijuana substitute (see [Cannabis indica](/en/cannabis-indica)). The two species are known locally as el macho, "the male" (S. rhombifolia) , and la hembra, "the female" (S. acuta) (Schultes and Hofmann 1980, 347*).

Both of these Sida species apparently contain ephedrine (Schultes and Hofmann 1992, 56*). When drying, the herbage of Sida acuta exudes a distinct aroma of coumarin. The leaves are said to contain saponins. Several studies of Caribbean and Philippine specimens of Sida acuta have demonstrated the presence of asparagine and ephedrine in the roots (Wong 1976, 132*). The alkaloids choline, pseudoephedrine, f3-phenethylamine, vasicine, vascicine, vasinole, and vasicinone have been found in all parts of Sida rhomb~folia. The stem contains the indole alkaloids hipaphorine, hipaphorine methylester, and cryptolenine. The leaves contain traces of an essential oil. The seeds contain sesquiterpenes (gosipol, et cetera) (Argueta et al. 1994,615*).

| Matricaria chamomilla L., Chamomilla recutita (1.) Rauschert<br><br>Chamomile was one of the most highly esteemed medicinal plants of Asclepius,Â· the late ancient Greek god of healing (cf. Laurus nobilis, Papaver somniferum). It appears that the temple sleepers who came to seek help found that chamomile was frequently recommended during their therapeutic and visionary dreams (R~itsch 1995a, 194*). It is uncertain why chamomile acquired its reputation as a psychoactive plant (Schultes and Hofmann 1980,367*). The entire plant contains an essential oil of complex composition whose main components are a-bisabolol and chamzulene. Also present are flavonoids and coumarins, which produce the well-known anti-inflammatory effects of chamomile only in connection with (synergistically with) the essential oil (Schilcher 1987). Apart from occasional allergic reactions, the toxicological literature contains no reports of truly interesting effects (Roth et al. 1994,489*). | Schilcher, Heinz. 1987. Die Kamille.

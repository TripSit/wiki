The genus Thevetia is composed of nine species, known as rattle trees or tropical oleander (Anzeneder et al. 1993,61*). The peels of the fruits are hard and are used to make rattles and clappers for Indian dances.

One species whose identity has not been clarified is known in Colombia and the surrounding regions as cabalonga blanca. It is considered a weaker relative of the true cabalonga. Cabalonga blanca is said to have magical powers and psychoactive effects and is used as an ayahuasca additive.

In Mexico, Thevetia thevetioides (H.B.K.) K. Schum. is known as yoyotl and is used in folk medicine as a cardiac stimulant and analgesic (Jiu 1966, 252*). Thevetia peruviana (Pers.) Schum. [syn. T. neriifolia Juss.], known as yellow oleander, is originally from Peru but is now cultivated as an ornamental in all tropical zones of the world, and it is the species whose chemical makeup is best known. The seeds are rich in cardiac glycosides, e.g., peruvoside (Steinegger and Hansel 1972, 193*). Eight to ten seeds is reportedly the lethal dose for an adult (Roth et al. 1994, 699*). In the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, Thevetia peruviana is known as palo de San Antonio, "tree of St. Anthony" (Aguilar Contreras and Zolla 1982, 196*). The name may very well be derived from a psychoactive effect (see [Claviceps purpurea](/en/claviceps-purpurea)). On the Gulf Coast of Mexico, in the territory of the Huastec, the plant is known as cabalonga de la huasteca (Aguilar Contreras and Zolla 1982, 196*).

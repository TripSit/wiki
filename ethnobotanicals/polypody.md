The Spanish botanist Hipolito RUlz (1754-1816), who traveled through South America in the eighteenth century, provided the first descriptions of many plants and returned with extensive collections of botanical materials. In his Relaci6n, he reported a number of experiences and provided ethnobotanical notes from Peru and Chile (Schultes 1980, 89*). RUlz described a polypody known as cucacuca, incapcocam, or coca del Inca under the binomial Polypodium incapcocam (nomen nudum), whose botanical identity even Richard E. Schultes was unable to determine. RUlz noted that the Indians had informed him that the Incas used the leaves of this plant instead of coca (see [Erythroxylum coca](/en/erythroxylum-coca)). Moreover, the powdered plant was said to be used (how?) in place of tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) in order to "clear the head" (Schultes 1980,89*).

Whether Polypodium does indeed have psychoactive effects remains to be seen, although it is possible. Interestingly, the root of one species of the genus Polypodium whose identity has not been specified is ingested orally together with the seeds of [Anadenanthera colubrina](/en/anadenanthera-colubrina). It may contain MAO-inhibiting Î²-carbolines (or other substances with the same effects). The root of the common polypody (Polypodium vulgare 1.), also known as sweet angel, contains small amounts of an essential oil, tannin, bitter principles, and sweet-tasting saponins (Pahlow 1993, 119*).

It is quite possible that there are other psychoactive ferns; even German folklore contains tales of filices, "ferns" (e.g., the worm fern, Aspidium filix-mas)-also called irrwurz ("confused root")-that have magical powers, make the devil appear, and can make one invisible (Marzell 1964, 33ff.*; Schopf 1986, 84f.*). There are also ferns that were added to beer. In Mexico, a fern known as itamo reaP36 (Pellaea cordata J. Sm.) is said to have inebriating effects (Diaz 1979,93*).

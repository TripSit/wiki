| In Gabon, the species Mostuea gabonica Baillon and Mostuea stimulans Chevalier, known locally as sata mbwanda or sete mbwunde, are regarded as potent aphrodisiacs. Their effects are said to be identical to those of Tabernanthe iboga. The roots of the plants, which have a taste like that of cola nuts (Cola spp.), produce euphoria and inebriation. The root was chewed extensively throughout the night and was swallowed by itself or mixed with iboga to produce sexual excitation (Chevalier 1946, 1947). Alkaloids are present in the genus Mostuea. The root cortex of Mostuea stimulans contains 0.330/0 alkaloids of an unknown structure. They have a pharmacological activity like sempervirine and gelsemine (cf. Gelsemium sempervirens) and effects similar to those of strychnine (de Smet 1996, 144*). | **Literature**<br><br>Chevalier, A. 1946.

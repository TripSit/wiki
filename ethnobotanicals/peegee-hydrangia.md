| This garden and ornamental plant, which is from China and Japan (Grubber 1991, 39*), has occasionally been described as a euphoriant, although its use is "strongly unadvised" (Schuldes 1995, 41*). When smoked, the dried leaves and flowers are said to have effects similar to those of [marijuana](/en/cannabis-indica). The leaves contain the isocoumarin hydragenol, which has been linked to contact allergies (Roth et al. 1994, 411 *). Other constituents include a substance known as hydrangin, saponins, and hydrocyanic acid compounds (Gottlieb 1973,20*). | **Literature**<br><br>Takeda, Kosaku, Tomoko Yamashita, Akihisa Takahashi, and Colin F.

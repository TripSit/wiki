This plant is native to China and Inner Mongolia and is the source of yuan-zhi (= yuan-chih, radix polygalae), which traditional Chinese medicine prescribes to "calm the mind" and "heal emotional disorders." It is used to treat nervousness, sleeplessness, forgetfulness, mood swings, and depression (Paulus and Ding 1987, 258*). Also known as chodat and hsiao-ts'cao, the plant was prescribed in Taoist medicine to increase brain activity and enhance memory. This may be the reason why it is occasionally regarded as psychoactive (Schuldes 1995, 63*). It is used in the manufacture of herbal ecstasy. The "active component" is said to be "senegine;" which makes up 70/0 of the dry weight (Gottlieb 1973, 11*). The chemistry is well understood. The root contains primarily polygalitol, tetramethoxyanthones, and triterpenes (Paulus and Ding 1997, 259*) but not a trace of psychoactive compounds. The very similar Polygala sibirica 1. is sometimes sold in place of this Chinese root drug.

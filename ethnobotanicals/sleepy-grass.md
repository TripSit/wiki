Various species of the genus Stipa are found from Texas to Guatemala. In the White Mountains of the region of the Rio Grande, Stipa vaseyi Scribn. [syn. Stipa robusta (Vasey) Scribn.] is known by the name popoton sacaton, which is probably of Aztec origin (Emboden 1979, 191 *). This grass is said to have inebriating effects and in Guatemala supposedly is used as a sleeping agent. A related species, Stipa viridula, is purported to have a narcotic effect (Emboden 1976, 161*). It has recently been claimed that another species native to the American Southwest, Stipa robusta, exhibits strong psychoactive effects. This sleepy grass lives in a symbiotic relationship with a fungus (Acremonium) that is thought to produce the ergot alkaloid D-Iysergic acid amide (cf. [Turbina corymbosa](/en/turbina-corymbosa)) in the seeds. It has been claimed that a dosage of nine seeds will produce LSD-like effects (DeKorne 1995,127*). Ethnographic evidence for any psychoactive use is lacking.

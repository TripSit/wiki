Since Piper methysticum does not grow in New Zealand, the Maoris looked for a substitute when they settled the islands. They found it in the form of an indigenous pepper species, which they used like Piper methysticum to produce a kavalike drink. The plant contains an essential oil with the active substances myristicin and elemicine (Bock 1994, 98*).

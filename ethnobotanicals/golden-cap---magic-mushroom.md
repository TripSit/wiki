| **Family**<br><br>Agaricaceae: Strophariaceae; Stropharioideae Tribe,<br><br>Cubensae Section<br><br>**Forms and Varieties**<br><br>The recently described species Psilocybe subcubensis<br><br>may possibly be merely a subspecies or variety<br><br>of P. cubensis (cf. Psilocybe spp.). Three varieties<br><br>have been described:<br><br>Psilocybe cubensis var. caerulescens (Murr.) Singer<br><br>et Smith<br><br>Psilocybe cubensis var. cubensis<br><br>Psilocybe cubensis var. cyanescens (Murr.) Singer et<br><br>Smith<br><br>**Synonyms**<br><br>Hypholoma caerulescens (Pat.) Sacco et Trott.<br><br>Naematoloma caerulescens Pat.<br><br>Psilocybe cubensis var. caerulescens (Murr.) Singer<br><br>et Smith<br><br>Stropharia cubensis Earle<br><br>Stropharia caerulescens (Pat.) Sing.<br><br>Stropharia cyanescens Murr.<br><br>Stropharia subcyanescens Rick.<br><br>**Folk Names** <br><br>Champinon, derrumbe de estiercol de vaca<br><br>(Spanish, "abyss of the cow patties"), di-ki-sholerraja dishitjolerraja (Mazatec, "divine dung<br><br>mushroom"), divine dung mushroom, golden top,<br><br>gold top, gottlicher dungerpilz, hed keequai<br><br>(Thai), hongo de San Isidro, hongo maravilloso,<br><br>honguillos de San Isidro Labrador ("mushroom of<br><br>Saint Isidro the Farmer" [= the saint of agriculture]),<br><br>hysteria toadstool, kubanischer kahlkopf,<br><br>kubanischer trauschling, lollli'um (Yucatec<br><br>Mayan, "flowers of the earth"), magic mushroom,<br><br>nocuana-be-neeche (Zapotec), nti-xi-tjolencha-ja<br><br>(Mazatec, "mushroom like that which grows on<br><br>cow patties"), San Isidro, San Isidro Labrador, tenkech<br><br>(Chol), tenkech (Chol: Panlencano),<br><br>teotlaquilnanacatl (modern Nahuatl, "the sacred<br><br>mushroom that paints in colors"), zauberpilz<br><br>**History**<br><br>Psilocybe cubensis (Earle) Sing. (= Stropharia cubensis<br><br>Earle), known internationally by the names<br><br>magic mushroom and golden cap, is originally<br><br>from Africa. It thrives on cattle dung and in<br><br>meadows with deposits of dung. In symbiosis with<br><br>African cattle, it has spread around the world,<br><br>although it grows only in tropical or subtropical<br><br>areas. Terence McKenna believed that this psychoactive<br><br>mushroom exerted an important influence<br><br>upon human evolution. According to his theory,<br><br>consuming these mushrooms resulted in a "mental<br><br>quantum leap" that transformed our apelike<br><br>ancestors into "intelligent beasts" with a greater<br><br>ability to survive. This psychedelic "primordial<br><br>experience" led to the development of the first<br><br>mystical mushroom rituals, which formed the<br><br>basis for shamanism, mythologies, and religions<br><br>(McKenna 1996*). It has even been suggested that<br><br>this mushroom was the original soma.<br><br>This mushroom was first found in Cuba (hence<br><br>its species name cubensis, "Cuban"). The Englishman<br><br>S. Baker provided the first description of its<br><br>traditional use in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) (Eight Years<br><br>in Ceylon, London, 1855 [1884]). The shamanic<br><br>use of Psilocybe cubensis in Mexico was discovered<br><br>during research into the magic mushrooms of<br><br>Mexico (cf. Psilocybe mexicana). There, it is known<br><br>as hongo de San Isidro, "mushroom of Saint Isidro."<br><br>Among the Mazatec Indians, Saint Isidro is the<br><br>patron saint of fields and meadows, the same<br><br>locales in which this mushroom-which is exclusively<br><br>coprophilous-is found (Heim and Hofmann<br><br>1958a).<br><br>Because this mushroom is frequently found in<br><br>Palenque (Mexico), it has been suggested that the<br><br>ancient Maya may have used it as an entheogen.<br><br>Before the Spanish, however, there were no cattle<br><br>in the Americas, and the mushroom requires their<br><br>dung to grow. All of the evidence suggests that<br><br>Psilocybe cubensis was introduced into Mexico<br><br>during the late colonial period (Coe 1990).<br><br>In Thailand, Psilocybe cubensis is now the most<br><br>commonly offered mushroom on the vacation<br><br>islands of Koh Samui and Koh Pha-Ngan (Allen<br><br>1991; Allen and Merlin 1992a, 1992b). The<br><br>omelets made with this mushroom are renowned.<br><br>It is also common in Bali (Walty 1981).<br><br>**Appearance**<br><br>The mushroom forms relatively large fruiting<br><br>bodies with slightly convex caps that can grow as<br><br>large as 8 cm in diameter. The caps usually have a<br><br>yellow or golden color at their center.<br><br>Psilocybe cubensis can be distinguished from<br><br>Psilocybe subcubensis, a Central American species<br><br>known as suntiama, only on the basis of the size of<br><br>its spores (Guzman 1994, 1472**).<br><br>**Distribution**<br><br>Psilocybe cubensis is found throughout the tropics<br><br>wherever there is cattle or water buffalo breeding<br><br>or ranching, including Mexico (Oaxaca, Chiapas),<br><br>Cuba, Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil,<br><br>Argentina, Florida, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia,<br><br>Indonesia, the Philippines, and Australia. In<br><br>tropical areas, the mushroom can fruit throughout<br><br>the year. The mushrooms usually sprout from cow<br><br>dung after it has rained.<br><br>**Cultivation**<br><br>Of all species of Psilocybe, this is the easiest to<br><br>grow. The mushroom produces more psilocybin<br><br>when grown on malt agar (Gartz 1987). Fruiting<br><br>occurs most readily when air humidity is high and<br><br>the temperatures are tropically warm (24 to 34Â°C).<br><br>**Harvest, Storage, and Consumption**<br><br>In the tropics, the fruiting bodies of Psilocybe<br><br>cubensis are easy to collect. During the harvest,<br><br>however, certain things should be taken into<br><br>consideration:<br><br>Although many people eat the fresh mushrooms<br><br>right from the field, this unhygienic<br><br>practice is to be discouraged. Some mushrooms<br><br>grow directly on the dung and may<br><br>possibly have particles of dung adhering to<br><br>their flesh. For reasons of safety, the wise user<br><br>should select only fresh, healthy specimens<br><br>that are free of insects and avoid those that are<br><br>rotting. Before consumption, [the mushrooms]<br><br>should be washed thoroughly with water; the<br><br>conscientious consumer will also cut off the<br><br>lower end of the stem.<br><br>To store, the mushrooms are dried in the<br><br>air at more or less room temperature (devices<br><br>for drying food are also suitable; they can also<br><br>be dried on a grate near a source of warmth).<br><br>Overly long drying processes and high<br><br>temperatures should absolutely be avoided.<br><br>When the mushrooms are crispy, they should<br><br>be filled into airtight containers. They can then<br><br>be placed in a freezer. In this way, they can be<br><br>stored for months with only a very slight loss<br><br>of effectiveness. The mushrooms should not<br><br>be frozen until they are completely dry (otherwise,<br><br>they will quickly lose their effectiveness).<br><br>They also should not be preserved in honey<br><br>while fresh (this will result in a disgusting<br><br>fermented mass). If the mushrooms are going<br><br>to be stored for only a few days, it will suffice to<br><br>place them in the refrigerator....<br><br>The dried mushrooms are clearly not very<br><br>easy to digest, especially when they have not<br><br>been sufficiently mixed with saliva. Mixing the<br><br>mushrooms with juice or chocolate breaks up<br><br>-the tissue and allows the psilocybin to more<br><br>easily enter into solution. It goes without<br><br>saying that the mushrooms should be mixed with these carrier substances only immediately<br><br>prior to consumption. Some users prefer<br><br>mushrooms that have been sauteed in butter<br><br>and are eaten with toast or potato chips.<br><br>Lightly sauteing them over a low flame will<br><br>not seriously lower the psilocybin content (it<br><br>may be better to fry fresh mushrooms, so that<br><br>any toxic components that may be present,<br><br>e.g., gyromitrine and other methylhydrazines,<br><br>will be destroyed). (Ott 1996, 191 f.)<br><br>An effective dosage of Psilocybe cubensis is regarded<br><br>as 3 to 5 g of dried mushrooms. The user may<br><br>want to use different dosages for different purposes,<br><br>ranging from mild psychostimulation produced<br><br>by a small mushroom to a "full blast" or a psychedelic<br><br>breakthrough (Terence McKenna's famous<br><br>"heroic" recipe calls for 5 g "on an empty stomach<br><br>in total silent darkness"). Psilocybe cubensis is the<br><br>psilocybin mushroom that is most commonly<br><br>available on the black market (Turner 1994,27*).<br><br>Magic mushrooms are usually consumed in<br><br>fresh or dried form. With time, certain specific forms<br><br>of ingesting the mushrooms have been developed:<br><br>Dipped in honey or powdered, the mushrooms may<br><br>be drunk with cacao (cf. Theobroma cacao). From<br><br>time to time, the mushrooms are also eaten with<br><br>chocolate (cf. Remann 1989,248*).<br><br>In Thailand, the mushroom is dried and then<br><br>smoked or baked into cookies together with hemp<br><br>(Cannabis indica) (Allen and Merlin 1992b, 213).<br><br>The fresh mushrooms are incorporated into dishes<br><br>in the same way that normal culinary mushrooms<br><br>are used. | **Ritual Use**<br><br>In central Europe, cultivated mushrooms are used<br><br>in ritual circles in the same manner as Psilocybe<br><br>semilanceata. In Mexico, wild mushrooms growing<br><br>on cow dung are used in shamanic rituals in<br><br>the same manner as Psilocybe mexicana.<br><br>In central Europe, this mushroom has also<br><br>been used with success in private healing rituals<br><br>(Strassmann 1996).<br><br>**Artifacts**<br><br>On the Thai "mushroom island" of Koh Samui, an<br><br>entire T-shirt industry has arisen that offers<br><br>tourists hand-painted T-shirts with mushroom<br><br>designs (Allen 1991; Allen and Merlin 1992a). The<br><br>mushroom is also frequently depicted on<br><br>Indonesian batiks (cf. Panaeolus cyanescens).<br><br>**Constituents**<br><br>The fruiting body contains a maximum of 1% psilocybin<br><br>by dry weight. An analysis by Gartz (1994,<br><br>19**) found an average of approximately 0.6%<br><br>psilocybin, 0.150/0 psilocin, and 0.020/0 baeocystin<br><br>by dry weight. The quantity of active constituents<br><br>is greater in the caps than in the stems (Gartz 1987).<br><br>**Effects**<br><br>As with all psilocybin mushrooms, Psilocybe<br><br>cubensis produces strong visions that often feature<br><br>shamanic characteristics:<br><br>The effects of the mushrooms [Psilocybe<br><br>cubensis] began by manifesting themselves as<br><br>waves of energy that ran through my body. I<br><br>found the beauty that was proffered to my<br><br>eyes to be even more valuable.<br><br>Suddenly a large snake glided toward me<br><br>from the desert that surrounded us and<br><br>slipped into my body. The next thing I noticed<br><br>was that I myself had become the snake. No<br><br>sooner had I gotten used to this condition<br><br>than a large eagle descended and snatched me<br><br>with its talons. My body shook from the blow,<br><br>but I did not feel any pain. The eagle held me<br><br>firmly in its clutches, ascended again, and flew<br><br>directly into the sky until it had become one<br><br>with the sunlight. My personal identity as a<br><br>separate consciousness dissolved. The only<br><br>thing that remained was the unity with the<br><br>light.

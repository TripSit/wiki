In Amazonia, this plant is referred to as bati matoshi or piqui pichana, and its dried leaves are smoked as a marijuana substitute (see [Cannabis indica](/en/cannabis-indica)) (Duke and Vasquez 1994, 154*). In Brazil, the herbage finds folk medicinal use as an astringent and antispasmodic (Grieve 1982,427*). The plant is known in central Africa as osimmiseng, and its leaves are used in a magical medicine for spells with Â«worms" (Akendengue 1992, 170*). Members of the Bastar tribe (India) make the leaves into pills that are swallowed to treat "weakness of the semen" (Jain 1965, 244*). The plant contains labdane (diterpenes).

The Rappahannock Indians snuffed the leaves and bark of this North American tree as a mild inebriant

(cf. snuff). Chemical studies and additional

ethnographic data are lacking (Ott 1993, 412*).

Virginia magnolia, which has a safrole scent, is also

known in the United States as swamp sassafras

(Grieve 1982, 716*). It contains an essential oil

that clearly includes a high quantity of safrole (cf.

[Sassafras albidum](/en/sassafras-albidum)).

Another magnolia species has been associated

with the Aztec inebriant poyomatli. Magnolias

have been shown to contain alkaloids, e.g., magnoflorine

(Roth et al. 1994,479*).

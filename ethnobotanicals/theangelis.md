<div>Pliny wrote the following about this plant, which</div>

<div>The theangelis comes from the mountains of</div>
<div>Lebanon in Syria, from the Dikte Mountains</div>
<div>of Crete, and from Babylon and Susa in Persia;</div>
<div>when drunk, it imparts magicians with the</div>
<div>ability to prophesy. (24.164)</div>

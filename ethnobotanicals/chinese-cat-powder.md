It is rumored that the dried leaf of this tree, which is closely related to the kiwi bush (Actinida chinensis Planch.) (Schneebeli-Graf 1992, 93*), is a potent inebriant or strong tranquilizer for animals; hence its common name Chinese cat powder. In Asian zoos, it purportedly is used to sedate large wild cats. The branches and young leaves of this plant are said to produce hallucinogenic effects (Grubber 1991, 60*). The bush is found in Manchuria, Korea, Japan, and western China and on the island of Sakhalin. Both metatabilacetone and actinidine have been found in this plant (Emboden 1979, 168*).

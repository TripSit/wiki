# Morning Glory Seeds

Morning glory seeds, specifically from **Ipomoea tricolor** (heavenly blue), contain naturally occurring **lysergic acid amide (LSA)**, a psychedelic compound closely related to LSD. These seeds have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples in Mexico and Central America for their psychoactive properties.

## Active Compounds

The primary psychoactive compounds in morning glory seeds include:
- **Lysergic acid amide (LSA)** - the main psychoactive compound
- **Isolysergic acid amide** - less psychoactive isomer of LSA
- **Lysergol** - minor psychoactive alkaloid
- **Chanoclavine** - ergot alkaloid precursor

## Effects

### Positive Effects
- Visual distortions and mild hallucinations
- Enhanced introspection and philosophical thinking
- Altered perception of time and space
- Mood elevation
- Increased empathy and emotional sensitivity

### Negative Effects
- Nausea and vomiting (very common)
- Stomach cramping and gastrointestinal distress
- Fatigue and sedation
- Confusion and anxiety
- Vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels)
- Potential for difficult psychological experiences

## Dosage

**Common doses** (number of seeds):
- **Light**: 50-100 seeds
- **Common**: 100-250 seeds  
- **Strong**: 250-400 seeds
- **Heavy**: 400+ seeds

**Note**: Potency can vary significantly between seed batches and suppliers. Always start with a lower dose to assess individual sensitivity.

## Duration

- **Onset**: 30-90 minutes
- **Peak**: 3-5 hours
- **Total duration**: 6-10 hours
- **After-effects**: Up to 12-24 hours

## Preparation Methods

### Simple Consumption
Seeds can be chewed thoroughly and swallowed, though this often results in significant nausea.

### Cold Water Extraction
1. Crush or grind seeds
2. Soak in cold water for several hours
3. Strain and consume liquid
4. May reduce nausea compared to eating whole seeds

### Germination Method
Some users report that germinating seeds for 3-4 days may increase potency and reduce side effects, though this is not scientifically verified.

## Safety Considerations

### Health Risks
- **Nausea and vomiting** are extremely common
- **Vasoconstriction** can be dangerous for those with heart conditions
- **Drug interactions** with MAOIs and other medications
- **Psychological distress** in unsuitable settings or mental states

### Legal Status
Morning glory seeds are legal in most countries as they are sold as ornamental plants. However, preparation for human consumption may fall into legal gray areas in some jurisdictions.

### Harm Reduction
- Start with lower doses to assess individual sensitivity
- Have a trusted sober sitter present
- Use in a safe, comfortable environment
- Avoid driving or operating machinery
- Stay hydrated and have light food available
- Consider anti-nausea preparations

## Contraindications

Do not use morning glory seeds if you have:
- Heart conditions or cardiovascular problems
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding
- History of psychosis or severe mental illness
- Current use of psychiatric medications
- Liver or kidney problems

## Drug Interactions

Morning glory seeds may interact with:
- **MAOIs** (monoamine oxidase inhibitors)
- **SSRIs** and other antidepressants
- **Heart medications**
- **Blood pressure medications**
- **Ergot-containing substances**

## Cultural and Historical Context

Morning glory seeds have been used ceremonially by various indigenous groups in Mexico, particularly the Zapotecs, who called them "badoh negro." Spanish colonizers documented their use in religious and divination practices as early as the 16th century.

## Legality

While the seeds themselves are legal as ornamental plant materials in most places, their preparation and consumption for psychoactive effects may violate analog drug laws in some jurisdictions. Users should research local laws before use.

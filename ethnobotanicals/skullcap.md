Skullcap is a component of smoking blends with alleged psychoactive effects that are offered as a marijuana substitute (see Cannabis indica). The herbage formerly was used as a sedative and nerve tonic and was even prescribed for the treatment of epilepsy, neuralgia, and sleeplessness. The plant contains the flavonoid scutellarin, which has sedative and antispasmodic effects (Foster and Duke 1990, 186*). A species described under the name Scutellaria arvense is reputed to have psychoactive or hallucinogenic effects (Schultes and Hofmann 1980, 367*).

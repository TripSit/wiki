| **Family**<br><br>Labiatae (Lamiaceae; Mint Family); Subfamily<br>Nepetoideae, Salvieae Tribe, Salviinae Subtribe,<br>Dusenostachys Section<br><br>**Forms and Subspecies**<br><br>Only clones or races of varying bitter taste are<br>known. The Wasson clone is very bitter and is<br>derived from plants collected in 1962; the "palatable<br>clone:' which has hardly any bitter taste, was<br>collected in Llano de Arnica, Oaxaca, by the<br>American ethnobotanist Bret Blosser (Ott 1996,33).<br><br>**Synonyms**<br><br>None<br><br>**Folk Names**<br><br>Aztekensalbei, blatter der hirtin, diviner's sage,<br>foglie della pastora, hierba de la pastora, hierba de<br>la virgen, hoja de la pastora (Spanish, "leaf of the<br>shepherdess"), hojas de adivinaci6n, hojas de<br>maria pastora, la hembra, leaves of the Mary<br>shepherdess, mazatekischer salbei, pipiltzitzintli,<br>sage of the seers, salvia, salvia of the seers, ska<br>maria pastora, ska pastora (Mazatec, "leaf of the<br>shepherdess"), wahrsagesalbei, yerba de maria,<br>yerba maria, zaubersalbei<br><br>**History**<br><br>The Aztecs knew and used a plant they called<br>pipiltzintzindi (literally "the noblest little prince")<br>in entheogenic rituals in a manner very similar to the ways in which they used mushrooms<br>([Psilocybe](/en/psilocybe) spp.). A number of authors have<br>suggested that this plant was Salvia divinorum<br>(Wasson 1962; Ott 1995, 1996).285<br><br>Gordon Wasson discovered the plant and its<br>divinatory use in 1962. That same year, the plant<br>was first botanically described by Carl Epling and<br>Carlos D. Jativa-M., botanists from UCLA. In the<br>1960s, Albert Hofmann was unable to discover any<br>active constituents in an initial analysis of juice<br>pressed from the plant (Hofmann 1979, 151-68*;<br>1990). The chemistry and pharmacology was not<br>clarified until the 1980s and 1990s, when<br>salvinorin A was discovered (Ortega et al. 1982;<br>Valdes 1994; Valdes et al. 1987; Siebert 1994).<br><br>**Distribution**<br><br>Salvia divinorum is endemic to the Mazatec region<br>of the Sierra Madre Oriental in the Mexican state<br>of Oaxaca. Apart from this, the plant is found only<br>as a cultigen among "neo-shamans" and in<br>botanical gardens. It occurs naturally in tropical<br>rain and cloud forests at altitudes between 300 and<br>1,800 meters (Reisfield 1993). Because of its small<br>original range, the plant is one of the rarest of all<br>natural entheogens. It is now grown by plant<br>enthusiasts around the world.<br><br>**Cultivation**<br><br>Propagation is performed with cuttings or<br>layers/shoots. All leaves except the topmost pair<br>are removed from an 8 to 12 cm long branch tip, which is then placed in water. The cutting should<br>develop roots in about two weeks. It can be<br>planted in soil after about four weeks. Salvia<br>divinorum requires a great deal of water and<br>prefers high to very high humidity. If the edges of<br>the leaves turn brown, this is a sure sign that the<br>air is too dry. As a shade plant, it does not tolerate<br>any direct sunlight, prefers dark soil, and needs<br>copious amounts of water, i.e., it should be<br>watered almost every day. Although the plant is<br>sensitive to cold, cultivated Salvia divinorum can<br>survive a mild frost.<br><br>Methods for cultivating the plant from seed are<br>currently being investigated (cf. Reisfield 1993).<br><br>**Appearance**<br><br>The evergreen plant is an herbaceous perennial<br>that can grow to over 1 meter in height. Its most<br>characteristic feature is its completely four-sided,<br>sometimes even square stem, which can grow as<br>thick as 2 cm. Its edges are angular. Both the<br>opposite leaves and the side branches develop<br>from nodes on the stem. The light to dark green<br>leaves are entirely covered in fine hairs and attain a<br>length of over 20 cm and a width of some 10 cm.<br>The leaves are lanceolate and tapered at both ends.<br>The panicled inflorescences appear at the ends of<br>the stalks and look exactly like those of Coleus<br>blumei. The campanulate calyxes are bluish or<br>purple in color, while the petals are always white<br>(Reisfield 1993; cf. Brand 1994, 540). In Mexico,<br>the plant blossoms between October and March<br>but primarily in January. In cultivation, the plant<br>seldom flowers, and fruits almost never develop.<br>Recently, however, one clone has been discovered<br>that develops fruits and seeds more frequently. A<br>hummingbird has been observed as a pollinator<br>(Reisfield 1993). The seeds germinate and begin to<br>develop, but with our current gardening techniques,<br>they all eventually die.<br><br>Salvia divinorum can be confused with a<br>similar, closely related Central American species,<br>Salvia cyanea Lamb. ex Benth. (Epling et Jätiva-M.<br>1962; Mayer 1977, 777).<br><br>**Psychoactive Material**<br><br>- Fresh or dried leaves (salvia divinorum leaves,<br>folia salviae divinorum, divination leaf)<br><br>**Preparation and Dosage**<br><br>The Mazatec take thirteen pairs of fresh leaves<br>(twenty-six leaves in all) and roll them into a kind<br>of cigar (quid) that they place in the mouth and<br>suck on or chew while retaining it in the mouth.<br>The juice is not swallowed, as the active constituents<br>can be absorbed only through the mucous<br>membranes of the mouth. At least six fresh leaves<br>are needed to prepare one quid (threshold<br>dosage), while more distinct effects will occur with<br>eight to ten leaves. When consumed in the form of a quid, the effects appear after almost exactly ten<br>minutes and persist for some forty-five minutes.<br><br>The dried leaves are best smoked by themselves.<br>Here, as little as half an average-sized leaf (two or<br>three deep inhalations) can be sufficent to elicit<br>profound psychoactive effects. Usually, however,<br>one or two leaves are smoked. The dried leaves can<br>be soaked in a Salvia divinorum tincture, after<br>which they should again be allowed to dry.<br><br>Dried Salvia divinorum leaves are becoming<br>popular as an ingredient in smoking blends and<br>even in the manufacture of psychoactive incense<br>(Valdes 1994).<br><br>Tinctures are prepared from fresh or dried<br>leaves by using an ethanol-water mixture (600/0<br>alcohol). The tincture can be either used to<br>impregnate dried leaves, thereby potentiating their<br>effects, or applied sublingually. Dosages appear to<br>vary considerably in their effects among<br>individuals. In addition, several experiments seem<br>to be needed before the effects become apparent.<br>Looking back, however, one realizes that there<br>were noticeable effects before.<br><br>For information concerning the use and<br>dosage of the primary constituent, see "Constiuents"<br>and also the discussion of salvinorin A<br>(cf. also Ott 1995; Siebert 1994; Valdes 1994). | **Ritual Use**<br><br>The shamans and shamanesses of the Mazatec of<br>Oaxaca use Salvia divinorum in divinatory and<br>healing rituals, usually as a substitute for the<br>preferred psychoactive mushrooms (cf. [Psilocybe mexicana](/en/psilocybe-mexicana), [Psilocybe](/en/psilocybe) spp.). Only a few shamans<br>prefer to use this Salvia. The ritual use is very<br>similar to that of the mushrooms (Hofmann<br>1990).<br><br>Salvia divinorum rituals almost always take<br>place at night in complete darkness and silence.<br>Either the healer is alone with the patient or other<br>patients as well as healthy participants are present.<br>Before the shaman and perhaps other people chew<br>and suck the leaves in the form of a quid, the leaves<br>are fumigated with copal (cf. incense) while<br>prayers are spoken and the quids are consecrated<br>to the higher powers. After chewing the leaves, the<br>participants lie down and try not to make any<br>sound. Both sounds and sources of light will<br>greatly disturb the visionary experience. Because<br>the effects of the leaves are much shorter in<br>duration than those of the mushrooms, Salvia<br>rituals rarely last more than one or two hours. If<br>the visions are sufficiently pronounced, the<br>shaman will have identified the cause of the illness<br>or some other problem. He then reports to the<br>patient, provides appropriate advice, and ends the<br>nocturnal meeting (Hofmann 1990; Mayer 1977;<br>Ott 1995; Valdes et al. 1987; Wasson 1962).<br><br>In Mazatec folk taxonomy, Salvia divinorum is<br>related to two species of Coleus. Salvia is la hembra ("the mother"), Coleus pumila (a species introduced<br>from Europe) is el macho ("the father"), and<br>Coleus blumei is both el nene ("the child") and el<br>ahijado ("the godchild") (Wasson 1962, 79). It is<br>this relationship that is responsible for the<br>psychoactive reputation of [Coleus](/en/coleus).<br><br>In the region of Puebla, a similar and botanically<br>as yet unidentified species of Salvia known as<br>xiwit is cultivated for use in treating the folk<br>ailment susto ("fright") and in rituals. The ritual is<br>said to be very similar to that practiced by the<br>Mazatec (Diaz 1979,91*).<br><br>**Artifacts**<br><br>The botanist William Emboden has suggested that<br>certain floral elements in the Mayan hieroglyphic<br>manuscripts may represent Salvia divinorum (cf.<br>[Nymphaea ampla](/en/nymphaea-ampla)). This interpretation is difficult<br>to imagine, for the plant is entirely unknown in<br>the Yucatan Peninsula.<br><br>The American artist Brigid C. Meier has<br>produced several paintings inspired by her own<br>Salvia divinorum visions.<br><br>A riotous novel titled Nice Guys Finish Dead<br>(Debin 1992) features Salvia divinorum and a<br>"super drug" called NICE made from the plant.<br><br>**Medicinal Use**<br><br>Indians use nonpsychoactive preparations to treat<br>defecation and urination disorders, headaches,<br>rheumatism, and anemia and to reinvigorate the<br>infirm, the aged, and the dying (Brand 1994, 541;<br>Valdes 1994,277).<br><br>**Constituents**<br><br>The leaves contain the neoclerodane diterpenes<br>salvinorin A and salvinorin B (= divinorin A and<br>divinorin B) as well as two other similar substances<br>whose composition has not been completely<br>determined (Brand 1994, 540; Siebert 1994;<br>Valdes 1994). The main active constituent is<br>salvinorin A, which can induce extreme effects in<br>dosages as small as 150 to 500 μg (Siebert 1994,<br>Zubke 1997).<br><br>Loliolide,286 a substance known from Lolium<br>perenne 1. (cf. [Lolium temulentum](/en/lolium-temulentum)), has also been<br>detected (Valdes 1986).<br><br>Neither an essential oil nor thujone, which is<br>known to occur in other Salvia species, has been<br>discovered to date (Ott 1996,35).<br><br>**Effects**<br><br>Most people who have ingested Salvia divinorum<br>in the form of a quid or tincture or by smoking<br>have reported very bizarre and unusual psychoactive<br>effects that are difficult to compare to the<br>known effects of euphoric or psychedelic substances.<br>Space is often perceived as curved, and<br>surging and rolling body sensations or out-of-body<br>experiences are frequently described as<br>typical.<br><br>Daniel Siebert has summarized the phenomenology<br>of the effects of Salvia divinorum in the<br>following way:<br><br>Certain themes are common to many of the<br>visions and sensations described. The following<br>is a listing of some of the more common<br>themes:<br><br>1. Becoming objects (yellow plaid French fries,<br>fresh paint, a drawer, a pant leg, a Ferris<br>wheel, etc.).<br>2. Visions of various two dimensional surfaces,<br>films and membranes.<br>3. Revisiting places from the past, especially<br>childhood.<br>4. Loss of the body and/or identity.<br>5. Various sensations of motion, or being<br>pulled or twisted by forces of some kind.<br>6. Uncontrollable hysterical laughter.<br>7. Overlapping realities. The perception that<br>one is in several locations at once.<br>(SIEBERT 1994, 55)<br><br>These effects are strongly reminiscent of those<br>that are experienced at subanesthetic dosages (50<br>to 100 mg) of ketamine (Ketanest®) (Bolle 1988;<br>Jansen 1996).287<br><br>**Commercial Forms and Regulations**<br><br>Living plants are increasingly available from<br>sources specializing in ethnobotanical products,<br>especially in North America and Europe.

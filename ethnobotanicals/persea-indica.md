<td valign="top" width="50%">This tree, a relative of the avocado (Persea americana

MilL), belongs to the indigenous flora of the

Canary Islands, where it is known as vinatigo. It is

said that a person should not take a siesta or sleep

under the tree because doing so will provoke a

state of inebriation. Goats eat the foliage and

branches with gusto, because it makes them

"drunken." A psychoactive use has not yet been

determined (vries 1993).</td>

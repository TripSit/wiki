Known primarily as a spice, dill has also long enjoyed a reputation as an aphrodisiac. It is also said to be an inebriant, for "the garden plant is numbered among the so-called legal highs; when dried and smoked, dill induces a mild euphoria" (Sahihi 1995, 153*). In the American "drug scene;" dill leaves are sometimes smoked mixed with glutamate. Dill contains an essential oil (approximately 4% ) consisting of carvone, limonene, phellandrene, terpinene, and myristicin. It is likely that dill is considered to be psychoactive because it contains myristicin (cf. Myristica fragrans) as well as dillapiol, a nonaminated precursor for the synthesis of DMMDA-2 (cf. Petroselinum crispum) (Gottlieb 1973, 12*). However, as Hildegard von Bingen noted, "[N] 0 matter how [dill] is eaten, it makes people sad" (Physica 1.67).

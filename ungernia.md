This little-known member of the Amaryllis Family is alleged to have psychoactive or even hallucinogenic effects (Farnsworth 1972, 68*). The biologically active alkaloid ungminorine was discovered in this plant (Abdymalikova et al. 1966). However, not even the botany of this plant is well understood (Schultes and Farnsworth 1982, 187*). It may have been confused with Boophane disticha.

Lycopodium clavatum 1. and other club mosses indigenous to Europe (Lycopodium spp.; cf. also Huperzia selago) are known by a variety of common names, including Druid's foot herb, Druid's foot, Druid's plant, Druid's flour, Druid's foot flour, witches' plant, witches' flour, witches' flour plant, witches' dust, snake moss, devil's claw, devil's claw flour, devil's rubbish, and disquiet. The spores are known as witches' flour, Druid's flour, lightning powder, dusting powder, and moss powder. These names suggest an ancient use in pagan rituals and strong associations with witchcraft. One German name, biiriapp, means "uterine ointment" (Beckmann and Beckmann 1990, 196*).

Lycopodium clavatum and similar species (L. cernuum 1., 1. hamiltonii Spreng., 1. serratum Thunb., 1. subulifolium Wall. ex Hook. et Grev.) are found also in Nepal. There, the club moss is sacred to the Hindu god Vishnu and is used in garlands and other objects at his festivals.

Club moss (Lycopodium clavatum 1.) contains a toxic or psychoactively effective alkaloid complex that is generally referred to as "c1avatine" which even includes nicotine (Roth et al. 1994, 477*).

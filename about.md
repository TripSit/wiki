# What is Tripsit Wiki?

The TripSit Wiki is an information portal which exists as a part of the TripSit Network, which aims to provide in-depth harm reduction information for all psychoactive drugs.

TripSit itself is a [community-orientated harm reduction community](http://tripsit.me/about), and our Wiki is being developed alongside our other resources to aid users in practising safe drug use, as well as gathering practical knowledge on substance use. We provide information both about specific substances, and practical guides on various aspects of drug preparation and use.

You can contact the TripSit team by sending an email to **admin@tripsit.me**.

# Other TripSit Resources

* [Factsheets](http://tripsit.me/factsheets) - Our factsheets contain compact and easily digestible information on a wide range of drugs, designed as a quick reference for users.

* [Main Website](http://tripsit.me) - Our primary site contains more information about TripSit as an organisation, and includes a blog where we post recent harm reduction news.

* [Webchat](http://tripsit.me/webchat) - Our public facing support chat, intended as an easily accessible online space where we provide 24/7 support for people who use/used drugs and share information intended to empower users. We aim to offer a safe environment free of judgement and negativity. 

	Note: This webchat is intended as an always accessible place for people to seek support from our volunteers and community members through a real time chat. As such we keep it clear of most social chatter, which would be better at home within our full discord chat community.

* [Discord](http://discord.gg/tripsit) - Our Discord server is home to a wonderful and evergrowing community of harm-reduction minded people who use/used drugs, as well as those who simply wish to support them. It is a fantastic place to make new friends while also becoming more informed about harm-reduction theory and practice.

	This discord server contains our peer-support chats, but it is also home to a robust offering of social chat rooms themed around both general subjects and various types of drug, as well as being home to some other fun activities.

	As with our public webchat, in this community we strive to provide a safe environment as free of judgement and stigma as we can.

# What is Tripsit Wiki?

The TripSit Wiki is an information portal which exists as a part of the TripSit Network, which aims to provide in-depth harm reduction information for all psychoactive drugs.

TripSit itself is a [community-orientated harm reduction community](http://tripsit.me/about), and our Wiki is being developed alongside our other resources to aid users in practising safe drug use, as well as gathering practical knowledge on substance use. We provide information both about specific substances, and practical guides on various aspects of drug preparation and use.

You can contact the TripSit team by sending an email to **admin@tripsit.me**.

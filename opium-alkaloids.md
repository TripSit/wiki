Opiate, opiates, opium compounds

The study of opium and the isolation of its constituents ranks among the most important achievements in the history of pharmacology (cf. Papaver somniferum). In ancient times, opium was already known as the best of all analgesics (cf. soporific sponge). The isolation of morphine from opium revolutionized pain therapy in Europe. No other component of opium has a comparably powerful effect. The potency of morphine would not be exceeded until heroin (diacetylmorphine) was synthesized (Snyder 1989). Subsequent pharmacological research has led to the creation of numerous morphine analogs (fentanyls), some of which are as much as 7,500 times more potent than morphine (Sahihi 1995,31 ff.*).

The opium alkaloids codeine and morphine have become culturally significant as psychoactive substances. Papaverine is used in medicine as a treatment for impotence.

Some opium alkaloids are also found in other Papaver species (Papaver spp.), although these species usually contain only traces of these substances (Khanna and Sharma 1977; Ktippers et al. 1976; Phillipson et al. 1973; Phillipson et al. 1976).

Aporphines, whose structures are analogous to those of the opium alkaloids, occur in Papaver fugax Poir. [syn. Papaver caucasicum M.-B., Papaver floribundum Desf.] and Nymphaea ampla. Other substances related to the opium alkaloids are present in Argemone mexicana, Eschscholzia californica, Nuphar lutea, and Papaver spp.

**The Constituents of Opium**

The composition of the alkaloid mixture can vary greatly, depending upon the strain of poppy, the location of cultivation, and the processing technique (Krikorian and Ledbetter 1975).

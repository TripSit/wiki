| Benzopyrones, coumarine· cumarines, kumarine<br><br>Empirical formula: C9H60 2 (= 1,2-benzopyrone)<br><br>Substance type: benzopyrone<br><br>Coumarin (= chromen-2-on, kumarin, 2H-1benzopyran-2-on, o-cumar[in] acid lactone), which has a scent like that of vanilla, crystallizes into colorless prisms and is easily soluble in alcohol, ether, and essential oils. Pure coumarin is exuded from what are known as tonka beans, and for this reason it is also called tonka bean camphor. Coumarin is biosynthesized by the hydroxylation of cinnamic acid or coumarin glycoside. Even plants that do not actually contain any coumarin often produce it when they wilt (giving off the smell of hay) or dry (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Galium odoratum, Sida acuta).<br><br>**Coumarins in Psychoactive Plants**<br><br>(from Gray and Waterman1978; Rompp 1995*; Shoeb et ai. 1973; supplemented)<br><br>Coumarins (e.g., benzofuran) have been found in the following plants with demonstrated or purported psychoactivity:<br><br>\| *Aegle marmelos* Corr. \| coumarin \|<br>\| *Anthoxanthutn odoratum* L.

More than six hundred natural coumarins are now known. About two hundred coumarins occur in the Family Rutaceae (including the genera Zanthoxylum, Evodia, Ruta, Thamnosma, Dictamnus, Eriostemon, Citrus, and Aegle), where they appear to have great chemotaxonomic importance (Gray and Waterman 1978; Tatum and Berry 1979).<br><br>Coumarins occur in some plants that are used for psychoactive purposes (see scopoletin). Coumarin is the substance responsible for the specific taste of woodruff punch, and it is also present in fahan tea (Angraecum fragrans Du Petit-Thouars), which Bibra (1855*) described as psychoactive. Fahan was once used as a substitute for green tea (Camellia sinensis) and was mixed with tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and rolled into cigars (Frerichs et al. 1938, 1234*).<br><br>High dosages of pure coumarin can cause headaches, dizziness, lethargy, stupor, and even respiratory paralysis (Roth et al. 1994, 796*). Coumarin is said to be toxic to the liver and for this reason was banned as a component or ingredient in food. However, the toxicity is very doubtful, and the alleged carcinogenic effects are also questionable (Marles et al. 1987). | In the United States, coumarin has been banned as a food additive since 1954. It has been placed in Class 3 of the Swiss Poison List. In Germany, drinking brandies (380/0 alcohol) are allowed to contain a maximum of 10 mg of coumarin per liter (Roth et al. 1994,402*).<br><br>**Literature**<br><br>See also the entries for scopoletin.<br><br>Gray, Alexander 1., and Peter Waterman. 1978.

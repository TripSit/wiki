This plant, which is supposedly also known as flore or chalviande, is said to be used as a hallucinogen in the coastal region of Ecuador (Alvear 1971, 23*). Whether the botanical identification given by Alvear is correct is more than doubtful. It may be that the plant being referred to is actually Ipomoea carnea, which is also called matacabra C'goat killer") (see [Ipomoea spp.](/en/ipomoea-spp)).

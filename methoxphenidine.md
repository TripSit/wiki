# 3-HO-PCP

**3-HO-PCP** (3-Hydroxyphencyclidine) is a dissociative anesthetic that belongs to the arylcyclohexylamine class. It is a structural analog of PCP and is known for its potent dissociative effects.

## Chemistry

3-HO-PCP is chemically known as 3-(1-(phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine-3-ol). It differs from PCP by the addition of a hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the phenyl ring.

## Pharmacology

3-HO-PCP acts primarily as an NMDA receptor antagonist, similar to other dissociatives in the arylcyclohexylamine family. It also has affinity for dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters.

The effects of 3-HO-PCP include:

- Dissociation
- Anesthesia
- Euphoria

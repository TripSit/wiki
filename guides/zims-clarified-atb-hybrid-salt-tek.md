# Introduction

This is a clarification of this Salt Tek, designed for people with minimal knowledge of chemistry and safety precautions. Read the entire tek before attempting, it will help you tremendously. I've revamped this tek because I feel that proper safety precautions are not advised in any others. This tek is designed to be **safe**, not the most effective, and for small amounts of Mimosa Hostilis. If you wish to extract large quantities, or to risk your life for some extra N,N-DMT, find another tek. This tek has an efficiency of 2%. You will extract 1g of N,N-DMT from 50g of Mimosa Hostilis. 50g of Mimosa Hostilis should cost you in the realm of $10-$20.

I am expecting some criticism about excessive safety precautions. I would remind you that Naphtha is simply a cocktail of undocumented organic compounds, many of which you do **not** want to be inhaling. Like other corrosive acids and alkalis, drops of sodium hydroxide solutions can decompose proteins and lipids in skin, eyes or other living tissues via amide hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis, which consequently causes chemical burns and may induce permanent blindness if it contacts your eyes.

# Supplies & Equipment

All links are to Amazon. Scale proportions linearly with increased/decreased Mimosa Hostilis supply. The total cost of supplies will be in the area of $100-400, including chemicals. Yes, there are teks which cost less, but you may irreparably damage your body by cheaping out. Further extractions can be done as-needed with a cost of about $15 per extraction. The required protective gear may seem intimidating, but if you follow this tek to the letter, you will have no problems. The cost may seem intimidating, but it's for your safety, and will allow you to extract DMT and other substances without worrying about exposure to dangerous chemicals.

# Precautions & Information

**Personnel:** I do not recommend performing the extraction alone.

## Sodium Hydroxide

**Eyes:** In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with running water or the eyewash station solution for at least 15 minutes, keeping eyelids open. Cold water may be used. Get medical attention immediately. Finish by rinsing thoroughly with running water to avoid a possible infection.

**Skin:** In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes. Cover the irritated skin with an emollient. Cold water may be used. Wash clothing before reuse. Thoroughly clean shoes before reuse. Get medical attention immediately.

**Mouth:** If swallowed, do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband. Get medical attention immediately.

## Naphtha

**Eyes:** High vapor concentration or contact may cause irritation and discomfort. Seek medical attention if irritation persists.

**Skin**: Brief contact may cause slight irritation. Skin irritation leading to dermatitis may occur upon prolonged or repeated contact. Can be absorbed through skin. Promptly wash the contaminated skin with soap and water. If this chemical penetrates the clothing, promptly remove the clothing. Seek medical attention if irritation persists.

**Mouth:** Aspiration hazard if liquid is inhaled into lungs, particularly from vomiting after ingestion. Aspiration may result in chemical pneumonia, severe lung damage, respiratory failure and even death. If swallowed, do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. Seek medical attention immediately.

**Inhalation without respirator:** Vapors or mists from Naphtha can irritate the nose, throat, and lungs, and can cause signs and symptoms of central nervous system depression, depending on the concentration and duration of exposure. If a person breathes vaporous Naphtha, move the exposed person (or yourself) to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, perform artificial respiration. Keep the affected person warm and at rest. Get medical attention immediately.

Most organic compounds present in Naphtha depress the functioning of the nervous system. However, the effects of each inhalant are difficult to determine because Naphtha is made up of many different chemicals and each person may breathe in different amounts of each chemical. Nevertheless, these chemicals do have significant effects on the nervous system, skin, liver, kidneys, and blood.

Some of the effects of exposure are similar to those of alcohol. The immediate effects vary depending on concentration and length of exposure. They include:
* Relaxation
* Slurred speech
* Euphoria
* Hallucinations
* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Loss of consciousness
* DEATH: Respiratory failure, heart failure

Long term inhalation of Naphtha can cause:
* Memory loss
* Concentration problems
* Visual disturbances; blindness
* Motor problems
* Peripheral nerve damage
* Damage to the liver and kidneys
* Contains benzene, which causes blood disease, including leukemia and anemia

**WARNING: NAPHTHA IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND EXPLOSIVE UNDER PRESSURE. DO NOT EXPOSE TO OPEN FLAMES.**

# Step One: Environment

Assemble your table if necessary. Lay our tarp over the table. If you have extra length, fold it under the table. You do not want to step on the tarp and send everything flying. If you are using a double burner, place it on the table and plug it in. If you are not, good luck with the stove. Keep your Naphtha as far away from the burner as possible. Your Naphtha, if stored properly, does not need to be on the table or near you.

Don your full protective gear before continuing. It is recommended that you perform the extraction in a very well ventilated and cool area. Your gear is going to get hot. You should not remove your respirator for two hours after you have ceased leaking vaporous Naphtha into the area. Six hours if the area is not well ventilated. Ensure that your emergency eyewash station is close to you.

Organize everything to avoid delays. Take an inventory of everything that is required before beginning.

# Step Two: Preparation

Weigh the bark. We want 50 grams of powdered bark. If our bark is shredded, grind it to powder. Place the bark in our mixing bottle, use the funnel if necessary.

Measure 200mL of de-ionized or distilled water (herein 'water'), add 60mL distilled white vinegar (herein 'vinegar'), place this solution in a pot. Use our thermometer to bring the solution just past it's boiling point: 213째F or 100.5째C. Pour our acidic solution into the mixing bottle. **If you are using a separatory funnel, do not heat the funnel in a pot as you would the bottle. Treat all instances of 'bottle' as if they were 'separatory funnel.'**

Pour tap water into our pot. We will be placing out mixing bottle in this so don't fill it too high. Bring the water to a boil, then TURN OFF the burner and UNPLUG it. The water should not be too hot to touch, just warm. You do not need to reheat the water until it has sat at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Shake our mixing bottle well and place it in the pot. Leave it to soak for 1-2 hours.

While we're waiting for our bark to soak out, place 100mL of distilled or de-ionized water in our second pot, and heat it to 190째F or 87째C. It should **not** boil. Weigh 30 grams of salt and stir until it's fully dissolved.

Once our mixing bottle has been soaking for 1-2 hours, pour our second pot's contents (saline solution) into the bottle. Use the funnel if necessary.

# Step Three: Base

**Never pour hot water onto Sodium Hydroxide. If you spill Sodium Hydroxide, neutralize it with vinegar. Immediately abort operation and dispose of the tarp if spillage is confined to our extraction area. If the spillage is off of our tarp, you will have to contact a company that cleans hazardous materials. You will kill yourself if you are not careful here.**

Weigh 50 grams of Sodium Hydroxide. Take a spare jar or the 600mL beaker and pour 200mL of **COLD** distilled or de-ionized water into it. **SLOWLY** add the 50 grams of Sodium Hydroxide to the water and stir with a metal utensil or glass stirring rod until fully dissolved.

**DO NOT POUR WATER ONTO SODIUM HYDROXIDE. IT WILL REACT VIOLENTLY. ADD SODIUM HYDROXIDE TO THE WATER.**

**Carefully and slowly** add our water/Sodium Hydroxide solution to the bottle. Use the funnel if necessary.

**Carefully and slowly** add another 140mL of de-ionized or distilled water to the bottle. Use the funnel if necessary.

Our solution should be around 700mL total. Cap the bottle and shake it well. The solution should become very dark. Place the bottle back in the pot and soak for another 1-2 hours, re-heating the pot as necessary. Shake the mixture every 15 minutes.

# Step Four: Non-Polar Solvent

## Add Naphtha

Measure out 50mL of Naphtha and pour it into the bottle. Use the funnel if necessary. Recap the bottle and roll the mixture in a figure 8 pattern for 20-30 seconds.

## Shake/Separate

**UNCAP THE BOTTLE MOMENTARILY TO NORMALIZE THE BOTTLE'S INTERNAL PRESSURE. RECAP AFTERWARDS. IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS, YOUR BOTTLE WILL LITERALLY EXPLODE!** Place the bottle back in our pot and leave for ~1-1 1/2 hours until the Naphtha separates. Repeat the shake/waiting for separation **FOUR TIMES**. Separation will take less time after the first, it should take you around 45 minutes to complete the remaining 4. 
**DO NOT REPEAT THE 'ADD NAPHTHA' STEP UNTIL AFTER NAPHTHA EXTRACTION (below), RELEASE PRESSURE BETWEEN SEPARATIONS.**

# Step Five: Extraction

Carefully use our glass baster to suck out the top layer of Naphtha. Do **NOT** suck out any of the basified (darker, lower layer) mix. Do **NOT** disturb the basified mix. **Be patient.** When it becomes difficult to separate without sucking basified mix, use the 3mL pipettes if you purchased them. (see optional equipment above)

If you did not buy the pipettes, suck out the Naphtha and as little basified mix as possible. Place it in our spare jar for later disposal.

Squirt our Naphtha into one of our glass dishes. On our first pull, the solution should appear milky. Later pulls will become progressively more clear, and possibly yellow. This is OK.

Use our plastic wrap to completely seal the dish, making it as airtight as possible. Immediately move the dish to the freezer. Leave the dish in the freezer for 12-18 hours. The longer the better. Do not open your freezer during this period of time unless it is absolutely necessary. 

Add another 50mL of Naphtha and repeat the above four more times. You want **five** pulls in total, minimum. Do not attempt more than eight pulls total, the product will be too contaminated to be useful.

Dispose of the Naphtha/basified mix in your spare jar. Clean with a hose outdoors. Do not remove your protective gear. Leave the jar outside overnight. Disposal of the mixing bottle is recommended but not necessary. Fill with white vinegar to neutralize any remaining Sodium Hydroxide before **thorough** cleaning. Clean all surfaces with vinegar. Dispose of tarp and all disposable equipment, including used pipettes.

Remove your protective gear only after you have fully disassembled your extraction environment.

# Step Six: Crystallization

Don your protective gear once again. Kudos for not messing up so far. Remove **one** dish from the freezer, repeat the following until all dishes are out of your freezer:

Take our spare jar and pour the Naphtha into it. Have a second backup container handy in case the jar fills up. **QUICKLY** use the funnel and/or baster if necessary. Place the dish upside down over a pile (at least ten-ply) of paper towels to drain any remaining Naphtha. Leave it for a few minutes.

The reason you must perform this operation quickly is because the DMT will be crystallized on the bottom of the dish. If you do not do this quickly it will re-dissolve into the Naphtha as it nears room temperature.

Quickly place the dishes against a wall and take our tabletop fan. Blow the fan against them for at least 30 minutes, recommend 60. Make sure that **EVERY LAST ATOM of Naphtha has evaporated**.

Your crystals may be suspended in a thin layer of oil. That's fine. Scrape all of the crystals/oil together and place the extracted DMT on a piece of paper or towels for extra drying. 

**Congratulations! You have successfully extracted 1 gram of N,N-DMT without any unrequired risk to yourself and others!**

# Step Seven: Re-Crystallization

This is how you get those fluffy snow white crystals. This step is completely optional.

## Equipment

* Third spare jam jar
* 50mL fresh Naphtha
* Shot glass or small glass dish with a high rim
* Eyedropper or pipette
* Small pot as before
* Metal mesh strainer or similar that can suspend your jar 1-2 inches into the pot's water
* Aluminium foil
* Rubber band

## The Process

Place your N,N-DMT in the jar. Combine your 50mL of Naphtha with the DMT. Fill the pot until 1-2 inches of water is above your strainer - this is important because it keeps the Naphtha from becoming too hot. Place the jar in the pot. The lid should be just resting on the jar to prevent fumes from escaping. Do **NOT** screw the lid on! The expanding fumes will cause your jar to **explode**.

Heat the pot until boiling for a few minutes to heat the naphtha in the jar. Turn off the heat and take out the jar (it will be HOT) and pour the naphtha into the shot glass with the product. Everything will dissolve into the naphtha and you will see the impurities start to separate and fall to the bottom. You can rest the glass in the heat bath to help if needed. After a few minutes you will need to decant the saturated naphtha into the other glass/dish leaving the impurities behind. Use an eyedropper/pipette to carefully pour it off. You can leave the impurities for the next time you re-crystallize. Remember that every little drop or smear of naphtha is loaded with product. A good wash around with fresh naphtha will get it all.  Take your glass and put a tin foil lid on it, sealing it with our rubber band to prevent dust and water vapour from getting in.

Put it in the fridge for 1 hour to cool, then in the freezer overnight. In the morning after 12-18 hours of re-crystallizing you will need to pour off the remaining naphtha and dry with a fan as before. It will take a lot of drying as the crystal layer will be deep and needs to be completely free of solvent. Scrape out your re-crystallized N,N-DMT. Storage is best in an airtight vial, like the ones found under optional equipment above.

**Congratulations! You've recrystallized your DMT without blowing up your jar. Kudos.**

The vast majority of synthetic drugs are white powders. A reagent test kit is the only way you can safely attempt to verify the identity of a substance without expensive and complicated lab equipment. This article is an introduction to the various kinds of common test kits including a variety of worldwide sources. It should be noted that these test kits cannot measure the purity of a drug, only its presence. If you've got more than one drug in a powder, it's possible that a reagent test may show the presence of only one of the drugs.

## Marquis Reagent

Marquis' reagent is used as a simple spot-test to presumptively identify alkaloids as well as other compounds. It is composed of a mixture of formaldehyde and concentrated sulfuric acid, which is dripped onto the substance being tested. The United States Department of Justice method for producing the reagent is the addition of 100 mL of concentrated (95–98%) sulfuric acid to 5 mL of 40% formaldehyde.

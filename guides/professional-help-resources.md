As a network dedicated to harm reduction, both staff and the members of TripSit put their best efforts in making sure that everyone joining the community is provided with the best advice in practicing safe drug use. Although being successful in helping many people that come through our community, despite our best efforts, there are cases to which is beyond the scope of help that we can provide. We would like to note that the people of TripSit, unless stated otherwise, are not professionals in the medical field, therefore we encourage seeking professional help be it a doctor, psychiatrist or a therapist and in extreme cases to have them go to the emergency room. Listed below are a few resources one can use to find the professional help near them. 

* [Addiction](http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/addiction/Pages/addictionhome.aspx) A site which contains lots of information about addiction to drugs and otherwise, geared towards an individual gauging their behaviour, and including many resources for how to help others and get help with addictions (focusing on UK users).

* [Addaction](http://www.addaction.org.uk/) A charity which organises social efforts in local communities to support and treat drug addicts across the United Kingdom, with over 120 projects in place around the country.

* [Identifying Thoughts, Feelings & Behaviours](http://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/cbtstep1.htm) "This self-help course  will be helpful for individuals who have problems with anxiety, depression or anger.

* http://www.ntw.nhs.uk/pic/leaflets/Depression%20LP%202013.pdf : At this pointyou may feel that nothing can be done to help. But there are things that you can do yourself which make a difference and there are also other places where you can helpif the depression does not seem to be getting any better. This booklet aims to tell you more about depression, how to overcome it and what help may be available. (Note this booklet is UK Based and some refferences to additional help may be restricted to the UK only but the booklet can still be very benifical to read).

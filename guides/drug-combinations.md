## Categorisations

*Low Risk & Synergy* - These drugs work together to cause an effect greater than the sum of its parts, and they aren't likely to cause an adverse or undesirable reaction when used carefully. Additional research should always be done before combining drugs.
 
*Low Risk & No Synergy* - Effects are just additive. The combination is unlikely to cause any adverse or undesirable reaction beyond those that might ordinarily be expected from these drugs.
 
*Caution* - These combinations are not usually physically harmful, but may produce undesirable effects, such as physical discomfort or overstimulation. Extreme use may cause physical health issues. Synergistic effects may be unpredictable. Care should be taken when choosing to use this combination.
 
*Unsafe* - There is considerable risk of physical harm when taking these combinations, they should be avoided where possible. 
 
*Dangerous* - These combinations are considered extremely harmful and should always be avoided. Reactions to these drugs taken in combination are highly unpredictable and have a potential to cause death.

### cannabis & mescaline

Status: Caution

Note: Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics.

### amphetamines & mescaline

Status: Caution

Note: The focus and anxiety caused by stimulants is magnified by psychedelics and results in an increased risk of thought loops

### cocaine & mescaline

Status: Caution

Note: The focus and anxiety caused by stimulants is magnified by psychedelics and results in an increased risk of thought loops

### caffeine & mescaline

Status: Low Risk & No Synergy

Note: High doses of caffeine are uncomfortable and this will be magnified by psychedelics

### tramadol & mescaline

Status: Unsafe

Note: This combination can cause seizures due to the lowering of the threshold by tramadol and the potential of mescaline to cause seziures.

### 5-meo-xxt & dox

Status: Caution

Note: The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions, particularly increasing the risk of unpleasant physical side effects.

### cannabis & dox

Status: Caution

Note: Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics.

### ketamine & dox

Status: Low Risk & Synergy

Note: Ketamine and psychedelics tend to potentiate each other - go slowly.

### mxe & dox

Status: Caution

Note: As an NMDA antagonist MXE potentiates DOx which can be unpleasantly intense

### dxm & dox

Status: Unsafe

Note: The DOx class as psychedelic stimulants have the potential to mask the effects of DXM and could lead to redosing to an unsafe level. DXM can also potentiate DOx resulting in an unpleasantly intense experience.

### pcp & dox

Status: Unsafe

Note: Details of this combination are not well understood but PCP generally interacts in an unpredictable manner.

### amphetamines & dox

Status: Unsafe

Note: The combined stimulating effects of the two can lead to an uncomfortable body-load, while the focusing effects of amphetamine can easily lead to thought loops. Coming down from amphetamines while the DOx is still active can be quite anxiogenic. 

### mdma & dox

Status: Caution

Note: The combined stimulating effects of the two can be uncomfortable. Coming down on the MDMA while the DOx is still active can be quite anxiogenic. 

### cocaine & dox

Status: Unsafe

Note: The combined stimulating effects of the two can lead to an uncomfortable body-load, while the focusing effects of cocaine can easily lead to thought loops. Coming down from cocaine while the DOx is still active can be quite anxiogenic

### caffeine & dox

Status: Caution

Note: High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating it may cause some physical discomfort.

### alcohol & dox

Status: Low Risk & Decrease

Note: Drinking on stimulants is risky because the sedative effects of the alcohol are  reduced, and these are what the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This typically leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, high risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. They will also  allow you to drink past a point where you might normally pass out, increasing the risk.

### opioids & dox

Status: Low Risk & No Synergy

Note: No unexpected interactions.

### tramadol & dox

Status: Unsafe

Note: Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and psychedelics also cause occasional seizures.

Status: Unsafe

Note: Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and in extreme cases heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.

### cocaine & nbomes

Status: Unsafe

Note: Cocaine and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation. When combined they can result in severe vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.

### caffeine & nbomes

Status: Caution

Note: Caffiene can bring out the natural stimulation from psychedelic drugs to make it uncomfortable. High doses can cause anxiety which is hard to handle while tripping

### tramadol & nbomes

Status: Unsafe

Note: Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and NBOMes have also shown a tendency to cause severe seizures

### maois & nbomes

Status: Caution

Note: MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably

### 5-meo-xxt & 2c-x

Status: Caution

Note: The 5-MeO psychedelics can interact unpredictably to potentiate other psychedelics

### cannabis & 2c-x

Status: Caution

Note: Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics.

### maois & 2c-x

Status: Caution

Note: MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably

### 5-meo-xxt & 2c-t-x

Status: Caution

Note: Both classes of compounds can be unpredictable alone

### cannabis & 2c-t-x

Status: Caution

Note: Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics.

### amphetamines & 2c-t-x

Status: Unsafe

### alcohol & 2c-t-x

Status: Low Risk & Decrease

Note: Both these classes of compound can interact unpredictably. Caution should be exercised.

### opioids & 2c-t-x

Status: Low Risk & No Synergy

Note: No expected interactions, some opioids have serotonin action, and could lead to Serotonin Syndrome or a seizure. These are pretty much only to Pentazocine, Methadone, Tramadol, Tapenatdol.

### maois & 2c-t-x

Status: Caution

Note: MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably, which could be dangerous given the unpredictability of the 2C-T-x series

### cannabis & amt

Status: Caution

Note: Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics. Small amounts can reduce nausea with aMT but take care.

### caffeine & amt

Status: Caution

Note: High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating the combination may cause some physical discomfort.

### amphetamines & cannabis

Status: Caution

Note: Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences

### mdma & cannabis

Status: Low Risk & Synergy

Note: Large amounts of either or both may cause strong and somewhat unpredictable experiences, which can be as intense as psychedelics. Consider rather Set and Setting are good, before you combine these. Cannabis should be saved for towards the end of the MDMA experience if possible, where the psychedelic alike effect won't come to play.

### cocaine & cannabis

Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Additionally CNS depression can lead to difficulty breathing. Avoid on anything higher than 1st plateau.

### ghb/gbl & dxm

Status: Dangerous

Note: Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the patient falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position. This combination is hard to predict

### opioids & dxm

Status: Dangerous

Note: CNS depression, difficult breathing, heart issues, hepatoxic, just very unsafe combination all around. Additionally if one takes dxm, their tolerance of opiates goes down slightly, thus causing additional synergistic effects.

### benzodiazepines & dxm

Status: Caution

Note: Small doses of benzos can end a bad trip, but both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and this can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.

### mdma & amphetamines

Status: Low Risk & Synergy

Note: Amphetamines increase the neurotoxic effects of MDMA

### cocaine & amphetamines

Status: Caution

Note: This combination of stimulants will increase strain on the heart. It is not generally worth it as cocaine has a mild blocking effect on dopamine releasers like amphetamine

### caffeine & amphetamines

Status: Caution

Note: This combination of stimulants is not generally necessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and greater physical discomfort.

### alcohol & amphetamines

Status: Caution

Note: Drinking on stimulants is risky because the sedative effects of the alcohol are reduced, and these are what the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This typically leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, high risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. They will also allow you to drink past a point where you might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less. Extended release formulations may severely impede sleep, further worsening the hangover.

### ghb/gbl & amphetamines

Status: Caution

Note: Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.

### opioids & amphetamines

Status: Caution

Note: Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.

### tramadol & amphetamines

Status: Dangerous

Note: Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.

### benzodiazepines & amphetamines

Status: Low Risk & Decrease

Note: Both can dull each other's effects, so if one wears off before the other it's possible to overdose due to the lack of counteraction

### maois & amphetamines

Status: Dangerous

Note: MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

### cocaine & mdma

Status: Caution

Note: Cocaine blocks some of the desirable effects of MDMA while increasing the risk of heart attack.

### caffeine & mdma

Status: Caution

Note: Caffiene is not really necessary with MDMA and increases any neurotoxic effects from MDMA

### alcohol & mdma

Status: Caution

Note: Both MDMA and alcohol cause dehydration. Approach this combination with caution, moderation and sufficient hydration. More than a small amount of alcohol will dull the euphoria of MDMA

### ghb/gbl & mdma

Status: Caution

Note: Large amounts of GHB/GBL may overwhelm the effects of MDMA on the comedown.

### tramadol & mdma

Status: Dangerous

Note: Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.

### maois & mdma

Status: Dangerous

Note: MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of  phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with MDMA will lead to hypertensive crises.

### caffeine & cocaine

Status: Caution

Note: Both stimulants, risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.

### alcohol & cocaine

Status: Unsafe

Note: Drinking on stimulants is risky because the sedative effects of the alcohol are reduced, and these are what the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This typically leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, high risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. They will also allow you to drink past a point where you might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol less. Cocaine is potentiated somewhat by alcohol because of the formation of cocaethylene.

### ghb/gbl & cocaine

Status: Caution

Note: Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest. Likewise the G can wear off and leave a dangerous concentration of cocaine behind

### opioids & cocaine

Status: Dangerous

Note: Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.

### tramadol & cocaine

Status: Dangerous

Note: Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.

### maois & cocaine

Status: Dangerous

Note: This combination is poorly explored

### ssris & cocaine

Status: Low Risk & No Synergy

Note: May reduce each others' effectiveness. Cocaine can reduce mental stability and therefore exacerbate conditions which SSRIs are used to treat.

### ghb/gbl & alcohol

Status: Dangerous

Note: Even in very low doses this combination rapidly leads to memory loss, severe ataxia and unconsciousness. There is a high risk of vomit aspiration while unconscious.

### opioids & alcohol

Status: Dangerous

Note: Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely

### tramadol & alcohol

Status: Dangerous

Note: Heavy CNS depressants, risk of seizures. Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. Place affected patients in the recovery position to prevent vomit aspiration from excess. Memory blackouts are likely.

### benzodiazepines & alcohol

Status: Dangerous

Note: Ethanol ingestion may potentiate the CNS effects of many benzodiazepines. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Blacking out and memory loss is almost certain.

### maois & alcohol

Status: Unsafe

Note: Tyramine found in many alcoholic beverages can have dangerous reactions with MAOIs, causing an increase in blood pressure.

### ssris & alcohol

Status: Caution

Note: Alcohol may potentiate some of the pharmacologic effects of CNS-active agents. Use in combination may result in additive central nervous system depression and/or impairment of judgment, thinking, and  psychomotor skills.

### opioids & ghb/gbl

Status: Dangerous

Note: The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position

### tramadol & ghb/gbl

Status: Dangerous

Note: The sedative effects of this combination can lead to dangerous respiratory depression.

### benzodiazepines & ghb/gbl

Status: Dangerous

Note: The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.

### tramadol & opioids

Status: Dangerous

Note: Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking other opioids. These agents are often individually epileptogenic and may have additive effects on seizure threshold during coadministration. Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present

### benzodiazepines & opioids

Status: Dangerous

Note: Central nervous system and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. The two substances potentiate each other strongly and unpredictably, very rapidly leading to unconsciousness. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position Blackouts/memory loss likely

### maois & opioids

Status: Caution

Note: Coadministration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with certain opioids has been associated with rare reports of severe and fatal adverse reactions. There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases.

### ssris & opioids

Status: Low Risk & No Synergy

Note: There have been very infrequent reports of a risk of serotonin syndrome with this combination, though this should not be a practical concern.

### benzodiazepines & tramadol

Status: Dangerous

Note: Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically present. Vomit aspiration a risk when passed out, lay down in recovery position if ingested.

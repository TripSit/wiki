**Methylphenidate** (also known as Ritalin, Concerta, Medikinet and Tranquilyn) is a [stimulant](/en/stimulants) which is commonly prescribed as treatment of AD(H)D outside of the USA, instead of [Amphetamines](/en/adderall).

## History

Methylphenidate was first synthesised by the Ciba Pharmaceutical Company in 1944, and after human testing which began in 1954 it first became available in 1957 under the brand name 'Ritalin' - marketed as a treatment for several conditions including chronic fatigue, depression and narcolepsy.

In the 1960s it was popularly used to reverse the effects of a barbiturate overdose, meanwhile also being sold in combination with other substances in 'health tonics' - the most notable of which being 'Ritonic.'

It was researched as a treatment option for ADD during its initial inception as a medically accepted condition, and has been available on a prescription-basis for this purpose since.

Today methylphenidate is available in instant release (Ritalin) and extended release (Concerta) form and also as transdermal patch (Daytrana).

## Usage

As mentioned above, Methylphenidate is in wide use worldwide for the treatment of ADHD - along with [Adderall](/en/adderall) it is one of the most commonly prescribed chemicals.

The drug is also widely used off-prescription, by users seeking euphoria or surplus energy and concentration. Similar to Adderall It is commonly used by students at exam-times or for other study, often sold at a premium by colleagues with prescriptions.

* Abuse or binging on Methylphenidate can lead to heavy comedown effects which can, in extreme cases, result in psychosis. Get some sleep every night, and see [Quick Guide To Stimulant Comedowns](/en/quick-guide-to-stimulant-comedowns) for more infromation.

* Methylphenidate has been shown to be habit-forming, take care with repeated use.

* Coingestion of [alcohol](/en/alcohol) (ethanol) also increases the blood plasma levels of d-methylphenidate by up to 40%.

As with all stimulants, remain hydrated and stay healthy. See [Stimulant Harm Reduction](/en/stimulants#harm-reduction) for more information.

### Interactions

See the [Drug combinations](/en/drug-combinations) chart for more information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Methylphenidate primarily acts as a dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and also as a sigma-1 receptor agonist.

Four isomers of methylphenidate are known to exist. One pair of threo isomers and one pair of erythro are distinguished, from which only d-threo-methylphenidate exhibits the pharmacologically usually desired effects.

The dextrorotary enantiomers are significantly more potent than the levorotary enantiomers, and some medications therefore only contain dexmethylphenidate (such as Focalin).

Methylphenidate taken orally has a bioavailability of 11–52%. The half-life of methylphenidate is 2–3 hours, depending on the individual. The peak plasma time is achieved at about 2 hours.

### LD50

The LD50 of methylphenidate in rats is 190mg/kg. In humans it is estimated to be 250mg+ for a 75kg (130lb) person.

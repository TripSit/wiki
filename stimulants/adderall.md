Adderall is a commonly prescribed stimulant to treat ADHD and ADD. Adderall is a 3:1 mixture of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine. Adderall is commonly found in two forms, IR and XR. IR is instant release, while XR is extended release. Adderall XR releases half of the dosage immediately, and the other half 4 hours later. Adderall, containing [amphetamine](/en/amphetamine), is exceedingly similar to other forms of the substance, though with Adderall the constitution and doses are known.

## History

Adderall was originally developed from an amphetamine blend drug called Obetrol, prescribed for obesity and weight loss. This drug was a mix of racemic amphetamine (dl-amphetamine), d-amphetamine, and racemic methamphetamine. This made sense, as it was for weight loss, so the peripheral effects of l-amphetamine were actually useful as an anorexic and as a thermogenic. It was later reformulated without the methamphetamine, but also without FDA approval. When Richwood Pharmaceuticals bought Rexar, the company making Obetrol, they rebranded the reformulated Obetrol (without the methamphetamine) as Adderall, and began marketing it for ADD/ADHD.

## Dosage

Adderall XR is extended release Around 50% of the dose is released instantly, the other half over the next four hours. Effects take a while to begin, and last much longer.

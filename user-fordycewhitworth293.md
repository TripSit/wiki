# List of N-Benzyl Substituted Phenethylamines

This article is a **stub**. As such it may contain incomplete or wrong information. You can help by expanding it.

This is a list of [N-benzyl](/en/n-benzyl) substituted [phenethylamines](/en/phenethylamines).

## Pharmacology

N-benzyl substituted phenethylamines act primarily as [5-HT₂A receptor](/en/5-ht2a-receptor) agonists. The N-benzyl substitution increases the binding affinity and selectivity for this receptor subtype compared to their parent phenethylamines.

## Effects

The subjective effects of N-benzyl phenethylamines are characterized by:

- **Visual effects**: Intense [visual hallucinations](/en/visual-hallucinations), particularly geometric patterns and color enhancement
- **Headspace**: Less prominent mental effects compared to other [psychedelics](/en/psychedelics)
- **Duration**: Typically 6-10 hours
- **Onset**: 30-60 minutes when taken sublingually

## Safety

N-benzyl phenethylamines, particularly the [NBOMe series](/en/nbome-series), have been associated with numerous overdoses and fatalities. They are much more dangerous than traditional psychedelics due to:

- Narrow margin between active and toxic doses
- Potential for [vasoconstriction](/en/vasoconstriction)
- Risk of [seizures](/en/seizures) at higher doses
- [Cardiotoxicity](/en/cardiotoxicity)

## Legal Status

Most N-benzyl phenethylamines are controlled substances in many countries. Check your local laws before considering research with these compounds.

# Volumetric dosing

Volumetric dosing is a relatively easy way to accurately dose substances in the sub-milligram range. It involves dissolving a known quantity of a substance in a known quantity of liquid, from there it's very easy to find the concentration of the substance on a milliliter basis. You can use our tool to help create your solution [here](http://volume.tripsit.me/).

## Why?

Some substances are active at sub-milligram doses. These types of chemicals require extreme precision that can't be achieved with consumer grade scales. Volumetric dosing is the only way to accurately dose the sub-milligram range in a safe and reliable manner.

There are 3 main reasons for volumetric dilution of a substance.
1) diluting a substance down to a safe range for use below the capacity of available scale.
2) diluting a substance down to a safe range below a threshold dosage to test for adverse reactions
3) diluting a substance down to a low micro gram dose to test that it is not a much more powerful substance then believed- ie , the recent bromo-dragonfly mislabeled as 2c-b-fly debacle.

## Tools

* A good (milligram) scale
* a liquid measuring cup, graduated cylinder, syringe with ml markings or the like
* A small funnel
* Small glass bottles with eye dropper. Alternately use a measuring pipette.
* Liquid for dilution- ethanol, high proof alcohol, water
* Sharpie / permanent marker

## How?

1. Research what your substance can be dissolved in, and at what concentrations. Some substances are not dissolved readily in water, and instead need a strong spirit such as propylene glycol or everclear. Sometimes, it is necessary to use a stronger solute when a higher concentration is desired.
2. Take the substance you wish to dissolve, and weigh it with an accurate milligram scale. (Generally you measure out a substantial amount more than you intend on dosing, to increase the margin of error)
3. Once you have a known quantity, you need to decide what concentration you want it. For example, if I have 100mg of a substance in powder, and I want 500µg in every milliliter of solute (A concentration of 500µg/ml) I would need 200mL of solute.

   * The concentration can be calculated with the following formula

     * quantity of substance / amount of solute = concentration.

       * Ex. 100mg/200mL=500µg per ml

       * **Remember: The lower the concentration, the easier and safer it is to dose! Ensure your margin for error is as high as necessary.**

## Safety

When dealing with chemicals active in the sub milligram range, there is substantial risk of accidentally dosing oneself while working with the chemical. Necessary precautions **must** be taken to ensure safety.

* Gloves, dust mask, and eye protection are **required**
* Wipe down all surfaces as soon as you're done using them.
* Do not work with substances in an area with a breeze.
* **Remember, just because you can't see it, does not mean it's not there. Chemicals active at quantities this low can be very hard for the human eye to detect.**
* **Absolutely do not** touch your eyes, ears, nose, or mouth while working with powders.
* You should mark the bottles in some way- this avoids confusion while doing this and is vitally important if they are stored. You may think they will remember whats what, especially if there are differences in the bottles- but **DON'T TRUST your memory!**
* Cheap scales are not precise. Use extra caution. Likewise- kitchen measuring tools, cheap, student grade lab ware, eyedroppers- they are all less then 100% accurate. Err on the side of caution at all times.

The Shuar of the Ecuadoran rain forest use this epiphytic, tropical pepper plant as a "mild hallucinogen." Parents given newborns who are just a few days old leaves that they have chewed. Older children are given the plant so that they may find their dream souls (arutam) (cf. [Brugmansia suaveolens](/en/brugmansia-suaveolens), [Nicotiana tabacum](/en/nicotiana-tabacum)) (Bennett 1992, 492 f.*). The leaves apparently are also used as an [ayahuasca](/en/ayahuasca) additive.

Several Peperomia species contain alkaloids (Schultes and Raffauf 1990*). Peperomia galioides H.B.K., which is known in Peru as piri-piri,335 is added to the [San Pedro](/en/san-pedro) drink (cf. [Trichocereus pachanoi](/en/trichocereus-pachanoi)) to lend the psychoactive effects "more clarity, brightness, and distinctness" (Giese 1989, 252*).

In Trinidad, the dried leaves of Peperomia emarginella (Sw.) C. DC. are smoked for asthma. The essential oil has antispasmodic effects (Wong 1976, 114*).

I'm 20 years of age living in Australia. Over the past 4 years I have regularly visited in various risk reduction communities including the dextroverse, dmt-nexus, shroomery and some lesser known communities confined to irc. For the past 6 years I have actively used a wide range of drugs always researching them extensively before use. This developed into a passion for both science and spirituality which has been notable for the past 2 and a half years. I'd like to contribute to this wiki to improve my own productivity and to show my gratitude for creating one of the few drama-free communities on the web.

If you need any more details feel free to email me at raw.endorfin@gmail.com or msg me on irc.
Cheers.

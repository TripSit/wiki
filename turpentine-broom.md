Shamans of the North American Kawaiisu Indians were said to drink a tea from this plant so that they could become "crazy like coyotes," i.e., transform themselves into these animals (Moerman 1986, 481*). The plant contains numerous coumarins that may have psychoactive effects. It is also possible that it contains N,N-DMT (Ott 1993, 420*).

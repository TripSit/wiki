Cannabis, commonly known in some regions as Marijuana, and by various colloquial names, refers to a genus of plants indigenous to Central and South Asia.<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup> The genus is scientifically subdivided into three species, Ruderalis, Indica and Sativa<sup>[[2]](#2)</sup>, however there is little scientific consensus on taxonomy and often little correlation between scientific classification and commercial descriptions of strains as 'Sativa' or 'Indica'. Commercial psychoactive strains of Cannabis are typically hybrids of Sativa, Indica and/or Ruderalis.<sup>[[3]](#3)</sup>

Whilst the Cannabis plant has various uses in production of fibres, it is most well known today for its psychoactive effects. Various desirable sensations are reported in individuals who have consumed cannabis, such as euphoria, relaxation, and sleepiness. Adverse effects include decreased short term memory, dryness of the oral cavity ("Cotton-mouth"), impaired motor skills and reddening of the eyes. Occasionally, cannabis can produce anxiety, panic, or paranoia. Rarely, cannabis has been implicated in the development of acute psychosis.<sup>[[4]](#4)</sup> [A full range of effects can be found on the Tripsit Factsheets.](http://drugs.tripsit.me/cannabis)

The primary psychoactive agent in cannabis is believed to be tetrahydrocannabinol, however the drug contains at least 65 other cannabinoids, and 485 compounds have been identified thus far in cannabis. The extent to which these compounds produce psychoactive effects is a matter of ongoing research.<sup>[[5]](#5)</sup>

Cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways, such as smoking, vaporisation, consumption as part of foods and in extracts.<sup>[[6]](#6)</sup>

Cannabis has been used throughout history as both a recreational drug, medicine and spiritual aid. 128 to 232 million people used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65) in 2013, making it the most commonly used illicit drug on Earth.<sup>[[7]](#7)</sup>

Despite this high usage, Cannabis remains prohibited to various extents throughout most jurisdictions.<sup>[[8]](#8)</sup><sup>[[9]](#9)</sup> The extent to which laws prohibiting cannabis usage are enforced varies worldwide.

In recent times there have been developments in the legal use of cannabis as a medication for various ailments. Canada, Belgium, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and 23 U.S. states have made medicinal cannabis usage legal.<sup>[[10]](#10)</sup>

## Etymology

The word 'Cannabis' appears to derive from the Greek 'kannabis', a loanword from Scythia or Thrace, where it was used to refer to the hemp plant. It has been in use in English to refer to 'common hemp', the variant of the plant used to create fibres, from 1798, and in reference to the psychoactive usage of the plant from 1848. It may have provided the origin for the words 'hemp' and 'canvas'.<sup>[[11]](#11)</sup>

## History

Evidence of cannabis cultivation dates back to 4000 BCE, in China, where it was used for the manufacture of strings, ropes, textiles, paper and food. The earliest known pharmacopoeia, *pen-ts'ao ching* (Classic of Herbal Medicine) describes medical use of the cannabis plant, which may date as far back as 2800 BCE.<sup>[[12]](#12)</sup>

> ...ma-fen (the fruit of cannabis)... if taken in excess will produce visions of devils … over a long term, it makes one communicate with spirits and lightens one's body…<sup>[[12]](#12)</sup>

But Chinese texts otherwise rarely refer to its psychoactive effects.<sup>[[12]](#12)</sup>

In India cannabis usage has been widespread for thousands of years, being entwined with recreational usage, medicinal treatments and religious ritual. The Atharvaveda, an ancient text of Hinduism dating back at least 2000 years describes cannabis as one of five sacred plants. Medicinal and religious usage of cannabis likely dates back at least 3000 years.<sup>[[12]](#12)</sup>

Cannabis first appears in ancient western literature in the account of the 5th century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, who described a practice of burning hemp to release vapour practised by ancient Scythians.<sup>[[13]](#13)</sup> This has been corroborated by the discovery of charred cannabis seeds in Scythian tombs.<sup>[[12]](#12)</sup>

Greek accounts exist of cannabis being used to treat a number of ailments, such as salves for wounds in horses, tinctures used to treat inflammation in the ears and the consumption of various parts of the plant for treatment of nosebleeds and even tapeworms.<sup>[[13]](#13)</sup>

Recreational consumption of Cannabis is described as early as the 4th century BCE by Ephippus, and also by the famed physician Galen in the 2nd century CE,<sup>[[13]](#13)</sup> however it does not appear to have been widely used.<sup>[[12]](#12)</sup>

By the beginning of second millennium cannabis began to spread from Central and South Asia to Arabia, appearing in Arabic documents from the period, and by the 16th century was widespread throughout Africa and areas of the Americas in contact with Europeans.<sup>[[12]](#12)</sup>

In the Americas the cannabis plant was widely cultivated, and its domestic production encouraged in the United States from 1600 to the 19th century, where it was used for textile and rope production. The 1619 Virginia Assembly made hemp growing mandatory for all farmers in the colony, and hemp was even traded as legal tender in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland.<sup>[[14]](#14)</sup>

The first country to outlaw the use of cannabis was South Africa in 1911, followed by Jamaica in 1913, potentially as methods of controlling the non-White population. Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand all illegalised cannabis in the 1920s, as part of a wider programme of banning psychoactives such as opium. Canada appears to have banned the drug several years before any reported use of the drug in the country.<sup>[[15]](#15)</sup>

By the 1930s a campaign to criminalise cannabis had developed in the United States. Playing on racism, xenophobia and general ignorance about the drug amongst the population, newspapers filled with editorialised accounts of 'reefer madness' and links between Cannabis and crime, often associated with the Black and Mexican communities.<sup>[[15]](#15)</sup>  
Around this time the word 'Marijuana', previously uncommon outside of a few Mexican communities became popularised by the anti-cannabis movement in a bid to make it appear foreign, strange and exotic<sup>[[16]](#16)</sup>

By 1933 30 US states had some form of legislation against cannabis.<sup>[[15]](#15)</sup>  
Throughout the 1930s the head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Henry Anslinger successfully campaigned for the illegalisation of cannabis, associating it with violence, corruption of white American youth, and immigrants and Blacks. By 1937 a federal $100-per ounce tax on cannabis cultivation effectively banned the plant nationwide.<sup>[[15]](#15)</sup><sup>[[17]](#17)</sup>

## Hemp

Hemp is the natural, durable soft fiber from the stalk of Cannabis sativa plants that grow upwards of 20 feet tall. Cannabis plants used for hemp production produce minimal levels of THC. Cannabis plants intended for drug cultivation cannot be hidden in a hemp field due to their differing size.

Hemp producers sell hemp seeds as a health food. Hemp "milk" is a milk substitute made from hemp seeds that is both dairy and gluten-free.

Hemp matures very fast and requires little pesticides or herbicides. It is environmentally friendly and can be utilized for 25,000 products, including clothing, biofuels, medicines, and construction materials. It has been used by many civilizations for the last 12,000 years.

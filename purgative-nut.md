| In the shamanism of the Ayore Indians of Paraguay, the dried root of the plant, known as caniroja, is smoked in order to communicate with animal spirits and to initiate novices into shamanism. The shamans (naijna) occasionally climb into a quebracho tree (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanca) and sit in its crown, where they smoke the roots. In this way, they are able to speak directly to the animals (Schmeda-Hirschmann 1993, 108, 109*). During a self-experiment under the supervision of one of the last Ayoreo shamans, no psychotropic effects of any kind could be observed. However, rhamnofolane and diterpenes have been found in the roots (Jakupovic et al. 1988; Schmeda-Hirschmann et al. 1992), which require further investigation (the active principle in Salvia divinorum is also a diterpene). In South America, other Jatropha species are regarded as aphrodisiacs (Schultes 1980, 104*). In northern Peru, Jatropha macrantha Arg. is known locally as huanarpo macho and is. one of the most famous aphrodisiacs for men. Further study is needed to ascertain whether this species has psychoactive effects. | **Literature**<br><br>Jakupovic, J., M. Grenz, and G. SchmedaHirschmann. 1988.

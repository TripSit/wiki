In ancient China, a species of the genus RanuncuIus (perhaps Ranunculus acris 1. var. japonicum Maxim.) was known by the names shui lang and maoken. Unintentional consumption was said to result in a kind of delirium (Li 1978, 24*). The genus contains glycosides (protoanemonin) (Frohne and Pfander 1983, 173*; Schultes and Hofmann 1995, 54*). Whether there really is a psychoactive species is questionable.

**Metonitazene** is an analgesic compound related to etonitazene, which was first reported in 1957, and has been shown to have approximately 100 times the potency of morphine by central routes of administration, but if used orally it has been shown to have approximately 10 times the potency of morphine.

Its effects are similar to other opioids such as fentanyl and heroin, including analgesia, euphoria, and sleepiness. Adverse effects include vomiting, and respiratory depression that can potentially be fatal. Because of high dependency potential and dangerous adverse effects it has never been introduced into pharmacotherapy.
